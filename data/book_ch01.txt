"Judith, mine ears hath been heavy with rumours that a witch has stolen the children and eaten them.", spoke a raspy and masque muffled voice.
"Rubbish! Tis the old troll down the road who hath done this. The town folk dare not meet this fellow because he is wild and might slay them on sight though he takes much pain to eat for show and eats them in playne sight and otherwise lays about in idleness.  They look to us because we too play fools with life and death.  An we play the saviors this time, they will accuse us as before.  In due time I will make a pie of pork and hemlock to give him slumber and there we must all take him to the sea and cast him there.  Send forth for my familiar for he doth not answer my call this time."
"Mine familiar Asmodeus! Quicken thyself! " came a raspy falsetto. 
"Why dost thou not stir!?" 
"O woes and pains hath befallen me here "
"As out of Magdalene went seven demons."
"Wherefore one not tarry here?"
"Nine years hast thou been suckled."
"Wherefore not portend to me this fate."
"And leaveth me with these dowdies?"
"Bridget, Hepsibah, Constance, Abigail, Mary, Anne, I give you license to depart."
"Judith, mother of crones, what desirest thou of thine daughters that we may not so soon hie off? Shall we feareth to abide with thee?"
"His soul hath swithly gone and thou needest our succor."
"Hepsibah, sister, his soul sleepeth before the fire."
"Wail not and fetch me a cistern and flint "
"Whereby we may take him unawares."
"Taketh thou dried moss of a bog, five old skins of a snake, a dram of moth-wing dust and three grains of a gnat’s liver."
"And bind these to a spell for him!"
"Mine familiar, tarry but a little longer with me!"   
"Asmodeus! Thou Fool!"
"From whence didst thou fall that thou wouldst force my hand to return thy soul?"
"It’s Mary.  Watch her closely!"
