	A red velvet curtain parted and a white billowing of vapours poured onto the stage.  Several of the audience members in the front gasped, scattered coughs were heard.  In the afternoon daylight, the sky seemed to dim accordingly.  Seven motionless faces peeked out of the fog which now filled the air in a thin haze. Tall figures in black shrowdes strode out in a dance to a slow and somber tune played by a small band of four players with cellos and bass violins.  They each were fitted with masques that bespoke of old hags. Noses and chins protruded thence whimsically painted with carmine lippy and rouge like the court mistresses and whores. 
	
	"Judith, mine ears hath been heavy with rumours that a witch has stolen the children and eaten them.", spoke a raspy and masque muffled voice.
	
	"Rubbish! Tis the old troll down the road who hath done this. The town folk dare not meet this fellow because he is wild and might slay them on sight though he takes much pain to eat for show and eats them in playne sight and otherwise lays about in idleness.  They look to us because we too play fools with life and death.  An we play the saviors this time, they will accuse us as before.  In due time I will make a pie of pork and hemlock to give him slumber and there we must all take him to the sea and cast him there.  Send forth for my familiar for he doth not answer my call this time."
	
	A stuffed fur shaped into a cat and mounted on wheels made it’s way onto the stage seemingly by itself and fell over. 
	
	"Mine familiar Asmodeus! Quicken thyself! " came a raspy falsetto. 
	"Why dost thou not stir!?" 
	"O woes and pains hath befallen me here  "
	"As out of Magdalene went seven demons"
	"Wherefore one not tarry here?"
	"Nine years hast thou been suckled"
	"Wherefore not portend to me this fate "
	"And leaveth me with these dowdies?"
	"Bridget, Hepsibah, Constance, Abigail, Mary, Anne, I give you license to depart."
	
	
	"Judith, mother of crones, what desirest thou of thine daughters that we may not so soon hie off? Shall we feareth to abide with thee?"
	"His soul hath swithly gone and thou needest our succor"
	
	"Hepsibah, sister, his soul sleepeth before the fire."
	"Wail not and fetch me a cistern and flint "
	"Whereby we may take him unawares"
	"Taketh thou dried moss of a bog, five old skins of a snake, a dram of moth-wing dust and 3 grains of a gnat’s liver"
	"And bind these to a spell for him!"
	
	One of the masqued robes brings out a cistern and vessels and hands it to another.  She stares wide creeping and stalking up on a point not seen and then she abruptly swings the open cistern as if it were made of paper in a wide arc over the imaginary point and lids it shut.  She leaps and twirls with delight.  A loud "Meow" comes from back stage and the crowd cheers.  They dance around the cistern and leap over it in turn.  As the band winds down, she hands it to the tallest one. 
	
	"Mine familiar, tarry but a little longer with me!"   
	Meowwwww.
	
	
	She takes a vessel and takes off the lid in which is born a white powder.  She lights a small fire on a censer and places the cistern on it into which she then places the cat effigy.  The powder fills the air, fog rolls out again onto the stage and they dance around the fire.  As the cat has now been obscured, young stage hands sneak their hands into the cistern, taking out the effigy and replacing it with a real cat.  The tallest hag picks up the cat to pet it and proclaims:
	
	"Asmodeus! Thou Fool!"
	"From whence didst thou fall that thou wouldst force my hand to return thy soul?"
	
	The cat meows loudly as if in response and she jolts upward as if startled and in awe.  The witches dance around again, tossing powder into the fire bringing flames that hurl ever higher towards the leaves.  Their vizards come off out of view as they round the fire, their faces younger and visibly male and gaunt but with girlish carmine stains on their cheeks and lips.  The music picks up and the crowd applauds the end of the scene and the act. 
	
	John stands up in his sergeant's cape and sword in its scabbard about his waist.  His dark curly hair and bright blue eyes meet Judith’s dusty green eyes piercing his back with an air of dread.  Their children, their eyes wide and still affixed to the stage sit bolted in place.  They are: John Jr., a sixteen year old boy, with long curly light brown hair and blue eyes like his father’s, the twins, Elizabeth and Henry, both tow-headed with grey eyes at fourteen years and Mary, ten years old with long dark brown hair almost like her father’s.   Two younger siblings are missing this evening.  Judith looks back at the stage deep in thought:
	
	The actors seem to have made a rather subtle gesture implicating her as a worker of the forbidden arts.  She would never make a pact with the Devil.  Was their use of her given name a coincidence in this small town?  She was the most widely known Judith in this town who could work the olde remedys.  There was only good in her working and it was nearly always efficacious.  
	
	As people were rising from their seats, a gentleman in a collar and tall black hat came by and passed a slip of paper to Judith.  He winked at Judith and walked past with a retinue of two guards and three young ladies and a man dressed as a coach driver.  She opened the slip, her husband peering over her shoulder.  It’s Mary.  Watch her closely!
	
	As she sat in the coming darkness of twilight, the guide who would take the audience to their various homes, came by with his torch and with that she arose in her husband’s arms to join her neighbors massing on the road and following the torch in the night.  While her feet were not as dainty as they once were, she could at least be spared the sprained ankles on the tiny feet of the town’s spritely, young maidens.  Those feet she could hear clacking over the stoney walk most of the walk home.  Some of these maidens had come out to theatre for their very first time and so she next wondered how many would be calling on her for a boneset plaster the next morning.
	
	Butter
	
	Mary Perkins, the ten year old daughter of John Sr. and Judith Perkins, with her pale skin, blush cheeks and black walnut hair woke up shivering, a thick quilt half covered her exposed arm out of her smock.  She stretched her cold arms, shivered and snuck back into bed pulling the covers taught over herself.
	
	Looking over, Mary saw Elizabeth empty spot on the bed, a big mattress stuffed with wool flock, then Henry’s empty spot and then John’s spot which was now covered. Mary slept next to mom, next to her youngest brothers, Jacob and Thomas and then dad who slept on the end by the door.  Jacob and Thomas were swaddled up next to her, the last three remaining in bed. Did they let her sleep in today? Mary looked at the empty book that lay beside her.  I will write a page every day. 
	
	She reached down to grab her overclothes and took up the milk pail to get outside and milk the family’s cow so she could get Jacob his breakfast.  On her way out, she grabbed some bread, dabbed it in some honey and butter and took the rest out with her on the way. She saw Elizabeth cutting wool to be spun later.  Mary was amazed how hard Elizabeth worked.  She had already finished scrubbing the clothes on the washboard and her hands were still fit for cutting the wool.   She could overhear Henry pleading with John:
	"Please take me duck hunting!"
	"Sorry Henry, you scared them all last time, I can’t take you if you want to eat game tonight."
	"John, I promise I won’t spook them. Please?" 
	Mom was tending the garden and dad was overseeing the farm hands.  
	
	As Mary started to milk the cows she started to become entranced by the rhythm the milk made against the side of the pail.  She felt a little pricking on her neck like a fly.  She then felt a squirt to the face as Henry grabbed a nipple and squirted her down, the cow also taking alarm to the point Mary was afraid it might take it out on Henry but it didn’t.  She squirted him back, he opened his mouth to catch it and laughed.  Always the tease.  
	
	"Do that and ye won’t fill your pail!"
	
	Mary was quiet this time, trying to focus through getting her chore done.  She felt tired even though she was rested.  She pulled a foxtail out of the neck of her smock...Henry apparent was bored not being able to go hunting but it was only a matter of time before he would be made to clean stables.  Henry seemed to get away with it having Liza on his side.  The fields were full of cowslips, orchids, poppies and cornflowers and the cows were eating their fill making the pails extra heavy.  
	
	There was now plenty of butter to make.  Mother was in the shade of the house by the hearthstone, working the dasher in the church.  Mary could hear the soft chant:
	
	
	"Come butter come, come butter come, Peter stands at the gate, waiting for his buttered cake" 
	Mary was tranced again but this time to the chant and the hand dropping the dasher with a twist in in rhythm to the kathunk-a-thunk-a-thunk of the churn.  It was a comforting sound she had heard since she was young.  She cradled Jacob in her lap and dipped milk out of the cup for him.  He’d swallow the milk to the same rhythm.  She’d feed her brothers while watching mom make butter.  Soon there would be sweet butter and buttermilk which would go into the cakes by evening.  Henry soon burst in with some wildflowers he picked on the way from the stable.  
	
	"These be a fine batch Henry! I will save these marigolds and violets!.", Judith’s eyes brightened. 
	
	Mary felt a scowl coming on but before it could come out, Judith turned to Mary with "So would you like to go visit grandpa?"  Mary’s heart leaped in delight.  She would give anything to take a break from the hot afternoon with the cows again.  
	
	"Oh we must go!"   
	"Then let’s get into our finery and out of these work rags...but after you help me finish the butter!"
	"Henry, a Firkin!"
	
	Within a few minutes, Henry brought in a smaller dark peat colored firkin that looks like it had many fillings of butter.  He gripped its lid attempting to free it from its vessel, but after a few puzzled looks, heaves and face reddened tries, he let out a long sigh: "It’s sealed too tight!".  
	
	Judith broke mid-churn to find a needle tipped wand from the table.  Being a cunning woman in Hilmorton and more well known than even she knew, she often had a curious and never-seen-before solutions to these odd little problems. She ordered, "Put it down in the center Henry and come over here!"  Henry put it down and Judith held out her hand, just barely touching the firkin.  She uttered the words as if she were calling out for someone named "Albertus" and then stopped.  Nothing. 
	
	A second later, Mary yawned, right into the base end of Judith’s wand and as soon as her ear popped, a great pop came from the firkin and the lid of it’s own accord hopped to the sound now loose.  Henry was now simply able to grasp the lid right off.  Judith smiled at Mary and Henry and Henry, after a moment of being awestruck, went to hand the firkin to mom as she pulled them into hug them and gave a "Blessed Mary!"  Mary smiled, feeling more recognized than she was used to and remembering just how unique and unusual her mother was compared to most.   After the butter making business was all put away, Judith called everyone in to wash and don their finest for grandpa Michael Gater, Judith’s father.
	
	Michael
	
	They step off the road, Judith carrying her one year old babe with her strong arms and onto a beautiful wildflower spritzed greenery which was thick with fluff, bees and butterflies.  A maypole stood to the side recently decked with bouquets of flowers and ribbons.
	
	Mom: "Father!"
	Kids in turn: "Grandpa!"
	Michael: "Judith, it’s been so long, your children are half grown!  "
	Judith: "Oh father, I was just here last week bringing you eggs and butter! "
	Michael: grins "Good son John, Come in and pray tell me what you’ve grown this year."
	They all enter, Judith has brought eggs and butter. 
	Judith: "I brought you some sweet butter lacking the salt."
	
	Michael eats some bread and butter. He takes them all out back to see his yard. Mary shows interest. The kids all play outside.  John is taking Henry through the woods.  Elizabeth is home with the babies. Judith is working on a supper.  Michael’s house is big and nice.  Michael has a big herb garden….Mary is amazed at the flowers and herbs there. 
	
	Judith: "Mary, would you like to stay here and help grandpa?"
	Mary: "I would most enjoy it mother. Thank you."
	
	Michael: "That one there is Lavender.  Mary my dear little lady, would you help me pick some of the flowers?"
	
	Foxglove, Wolfsbane, Comfrey, Lavender
	
	"I can make a salve that can heal scrapes with that one."
	"I’m going to teach you a technique for making the salve called enfleurage"
	"First you must flatten the butter and I like to melt it in the sun and then take it into the cool room"  
	"While it’s still melted, put all the flower petals in the butter"
	"Now we’ll roll it around into a ball, knead it around. "
	"Won’t I get them greasy?" 
	"Wet your hands in the water first and it won’t be so bad."
	"That’s the way."
	
	
	
	"Now let’s melt it again in the sun and drain it through the cloth and into the second dish"
	"Pick some more flowers for me will you?"
	"Wonderful Mary, let’s do this a couple more times".
	
	Michael showed Mary how to make a violet flavored honey for coughs, a yarrow and mugwort  tincture for toothaches and fits and a comfrey and mint tea for broken bones.  He smiled brightly and for a moment his face seemed about as young as her older brother Henry’s despite being sixty years in age. 
	
	They went out to the tomatoes and he showed her how to pollinate the tomatoes, how to make a compost tea and showed her a beehive that helped to make honey.  He got a still of grain alcohol that he used to make the tincture. (history check).  She asked him why her strawberries didn’t grow...he told her that different plants take to different soils.  Strawberries like the sandy kind.
	
	Mary goes back home and shows all the wonderful stuff she made in little pots.
	
	"Elizabeth, I had such a wonderful time, I learned so much, I have to tell you about the flower butter I made!"
	
	Elizabeth gives a stern look and throws a rag at Mary.  "Want to know what I did all week?"  
	She points at a pile of pots.
	
	
	Mary stares at the pot that Elizabeth pointed at and one falls down and breaks.  Henry comes in looking a little shocked but also like it’s not surprising.  Elizabeth ignored it as if to assume Mary might have brushed it and knocked it over, already somewhat blinded by her anger.  Elizabeth stomps with "Oooooh! You clumsy fool!" and throws down a broom and stomps off.  Mary begins to sob...walks slowly to the broom and starts to sweep.  Henry approaches Mary and puts his arm around her.  
	"It’s not your fault, she’s been like this all week. "
	
	Mary stopped sobbing but was still blush in the face and was aching in the pit of her stomach. As she looks up at Henry, she looks as if she would break into sobs again.  
	
	"Please don’t Mary… Elizabeth drops things herself sometimes.  You know, sometimes, it’s meant to be.  Little accidents make life interesting.  Who knows, maybe it is our Lord’s greater purpose to keep us well by not having us eat from old dishes...maybe.  Or maybe it would have later fell on my toe!  So thank you Mary, thank you for saving my big toe!"
	"Mary, I got to go to grandpa’s last year too and he taught me a few of those things. Did he show you how to make the anise and mint liqueur or the dandelion wine?"
	"Not yet"
	"Tell me everything he taught you."
	"Well, we made a wonderful violet cough honey. It’s almost like candy, I had snuck a taste and it’s so sweet like a flower nectar."  
	"Oh, now he didn’t tell me that.  He didn’t let me drink any of it the stuff we made...said it had to be for pains and ailments or for when I got older and wanted a good tonic."
	Mary hugs Henry.
	"Thank you Henry."
	"Any time you want someone to talk to, I’m here for you.  You mustn’t forget it!"
	
	Mary thought a little better of Henry from that time forward.  It was only the following week that mom went to look for Michael and he had been laying in his chair, quiet and breathing shallow and in a raspy note.  Judith stayed by him all the night watching over him and making sure he was kept warm with freshly warmed stones from the hearth...she tried to feed him but he simply brushed it weakly aside.  It wasn’t but an hour later that he stopped breathing altogether. 
	
	When Judith returned, Mary heard the news of grandpa’s death and cried in her mom’s arms.  Mom took the long white apron from the front of her skirt and wiped Mary’s tears and patted her cheeks dry.  Michael was the only grandparent she knew and death of someone she knew was a new experience to her.  Her father went out with the boys to bury his father in law and hold a wake there.
	
	
	Isabel
	
	Next day, Judith and Mary had both been given the day to mourn and the men of the family did much of their work.  Judith chanted the butter tune mournfully and slowly this time.  She’d look over at Mary and they both held a tear in their eye as they woefully exchanged sympathetic glances. As dusk soon arrived, Judith pulled herself up and put on her cloak.  
	
	"Mary, I’m going to take you to our kin’s land"
	
	With that, she took out Mary’s cloak and they both went out.  Elizabeth was still tending to the babies that day, also in mourning, veiling her face. 
	
	Outside the door Judith told her "Elizabeth’s been out earlier today laying flowers on all the graves, and praying to the good Lord if he would send them to find papa". 
	
	"This is where mama is buried. " 
	
	Isabel Baylie was written on the tombstone.  
	A gale of wind came through and rocked the tree branches making a few twig snaps and creaks like the beams in a stony church.  The dusk was now at its dimmest and the night fall within the hour.  A green orb gently grew, floating above the other headstones and trees, a will-o-the-wisp.  Judith seemed to take it fairly seriously as a sign.  To Mary, these were common to the marshlands and while she may have seen one from a distance before, she never saw one up close.  Judith broke out with verse:
	
	
	The Master is here.
	And long would I tarry
	But I open my cove
	By St. Peter and Mary
	
	A tap on the tree with a stick produced a very curious motion.  Immediately, the vines parted over what now appeared to be a natural tree hollow archway that led into a cellar built into the cool north face of the hill.  
	
	"Come with me Mary"
	
	Inside this cellar was a wall of masonry.  It was like a small mausoleum and a laboratory where a single casket lay and built in shelves of bottles lined most of one wall and a wall of skulls partially filled another.  Mary held onto dear breath as she beheld it’s marvel.  
	
	Her mom guided her by the arm to a chair and table in the middle of the room.  
	
	"Today, I will share with you what my mother shared with me."
	"You will carry forward the wisdom of the wives, continue our tales and our trade"
	"I do not ask an oath but as we are surrounded here by our mothers, what we say here will be binding. Are you willing to stay?"
	"Yes mother."
	
	"I reveal to you now that I am both your mother and your Queen.  A child’s loyalty is naturally to their mother first.  This has not changed but has only become more sure.  Your blood is precious and royal.  You are an heir princess. Please, talk and ask me anything you wish freely."
	
	"So if I am a princess, who will be my subjects?"
	
	"But we are not the Queens of this land.  No, we are the Queens of something greater, a hidden kingdom that is as invisible as air and thought.  The Realm of Wisdom, the crowning jewel of all mental powers. Many girls are gifted but you will be their ruler.  If you cannot rule in force, then you will rule in influence and suggestion. Essentially, you will rule others without them knowing they are being ruled." 
	
	"Who can I tell?"
	
	"You cannot tell anyone.  We rule for power in ideas over glory.  You will write books and your readers will be your court.   You may pass this secret on to your daughter, any fair-not-handsome son you have, and as a last resort, your most kindred in spirit who has manifested a gift.. I will give to you learning and tests in the arts of healing, charm, reading and writing, consultation with the spirits, both your ancestors and the dead of others. You will work miracle...some that are understood and that are not.  Some will call you a demon and some will call you an angel, a witch, or a good wife. Do not boast of yourself and call yourself anything. Let your virtues be your only title. "
	
	Judith lit a fire in a fireplace in the dark with what seemed to be a mere snap of the fingers.  Did she know some formula for fire or was she so powerful that she could summon instant fire?  The cold started to slowly fade into warmth and light. 
	
	"You can have great influence even without fame.  Protect your name and your power with the strongest of shields and that is secrecy. To have power is to be free.  To be free, you cannot be in debt of mind to dogmas.  You cannot be in debit to the gaoler by doing someone harm.  You shall not act against their will and in so doing cause a rebellion against you.  You will not contest their idea of their deity.  It is futile.  Do no harm to yourself.  Do all you can to survive and continue.  Subject yourself to no one other than your mother and your conscience, and do not borrow unless not doing so would cause you to commit act against the former. You may worship what you may and be loyal to your own dearest spirit or deity but to not enslave yourself to church or kingdom except it be to respect the wishes that do not contest your own or to avoid being discovered.  You may follow their just intentions.  You can appear to be theirs.  You can serve your fellows but only after you serve your future generation.  While you don’t have to subject yourself to them, it is your duty to serve and influence and in so doing have power and magic on your side.  Set trends, whisper and listen wherever you go."  
	
	Judith paused to breath: "First, I give you your magic wand.  You can create anything you want with this."
	
	"How can I do that?"
	
	"Just believe me, it will come to you.  Your first test of magic is to summon a bird.  The best bird you can."  Judith handed Mary a pencil.  Mary suddenly realized what was expected.  She had watched mom draw before.  Mary took the pencil and sketched a bird.  Judith lit a candle and left her there to draw.  Mary finished sketching but then noticed her mother had left.  For a moment, Mary thought her mom might have just vanished or flew up the chimney given what she just saw.  Mary started to get scared but she waited patiently.  Mary couldn’t tell if it was day or night after a while.  Mary had drawn a blue jay. In the passing hours, Mary took time to perfect her drawing in little details. After she finished drawing, she slept at the table.  When she awoke, Judith had returned.
	
	"This looks very nice.  I am not judging you solely on talent.  You can tell a lot about a person by how they draw a simple image of a bird.  This is beautiful Mary.  You’ve surpassed my expectations and I can see now what you can do Mary and I will help you master it.  I give you the name Corinna.  It means you are a Raven and a Queen raven is to a king like a dragon is to a catfish.  You can do what your heart speaks with this gift and you can fly into the night."
	
	
	Judith put her hand on the door and held it there as she cautioned Mary:
	
	"Tell no one of this place, use it only when you need to escape but let none follow you here.  In that case, lead them to their own danger.  If anything befalls this place, it is up to you to make another like it and at least as hidden if you can manage it."
	
	Mary smiled.  She heard some birds chirping at that point and looked about and saw that early dawn light was starting to break through where they had entered late at dusk.  As Mary emerged, the world seemed brighter, happier somehow.  
	
	Stew
	
	Being that it was the height of summer, the Perkins children were starting to get dull and feel some effects of cabin fever.  In Hilmorton there were a few taverns where Sergeant John Perkins went.  John would occasionally see a family stop to eat at these but  not stay in overnight.  John handed Judith a purse and said, 
	
	"Take the children out to one of the ordinaries on the main road and let them eat whatever they want. "
	
	Judith realized she’d need to pack for her tots there.  There were occasionally women who even breastfeed or found wet nurses at the ordinaries. Always a lot of activity there, there would be some items to take to the trading post.  Her husband often guarded these to ensure there was no troubles from drunkenness or theft there.  The family often went there together and settled by other ladies and their husbands to avoid being near the bar area where courting and drinking occurred.  Soon enough, they arrived at the public gathering house to make rounds, say hellos and sell the items they could sell to the merchant there who would resell it for a profit. Judith took Thomas and Jacob with her to chat with a mother who had just had her first child.  John, seeing some of his friends left to chat with them and left the money bag with Henry.  Elizabeth, Henry and Mary took a corner table all to themselves.  Henry ordered a plate of stew and a pot of ale.  Elizabeth and Mary were quiet and Henry passed a look to Elizabeth.
	
	"Mary, I’m sorry I was cross with you.", spoke Elizabeth.  
	"I am sorry…" started Mary
	"No, don’t apologize little sister, I searched my heart and found jealousy towards you.  It is my sin.  I should be more stalwart as your older sister to check my heart when it comes to what you receive.  I usually receive those things first before you.  I was not wise to forget that.  My melancholy and pains have been working on me. Forgive me?"
	Henry smiled and nodded at Mary. 
	"Yes, of course.  You’re my older sister and I do all in my power to be true to you and share all I have with you."  Mary thought back to her night in the cove.  She didn’t know if Elizabeth knew all this or not.  They had not had any instruction on what they could discuss with each other. 
	"I think I know how you’re feeling Mary.  I know you have gifts of the spirits"
	"Elizabeth, can we speak of such here?"
	"Oh, I was not going to say much more little sister. Don’t fret."
	"Dinner is served!" announced the bar keeper. With that, a large plate steaming with hot brown gravies, smelling like a Christmas roast came out.  Cooked beets, rutabagas and carrots glistened among the chunks of meat."
	Mary’s eyes were much bigger than her stomach but over the course of the hour, the three of them finished every last bit. Just before they left, they noticed some footmen storm into the dining area.  Mary over heard one: I’ll be hanging in chains if I don’t find it immediately!  Another: I swore it was right here!  Another: Some pick pocket’s unlucky day just arrived.     
	
	
	Henry was lazily leaving the table.  Mary grabbed the Perkin’s coin pouch and with Elizabeth, ran ahead to meet mother at the door.  Out of Mary’s sight, Henry grabbed another similar looking coin pouch on the wood backed benches they sat in.  Henry lagged behind a little so as they were leaving, one of the soldiers pointed to Henry’s pouch shouting in a peasant voice: 
	"I caught him the little cutpurse!".  Mary looked around not finding Henry, the soldiers were blocking her view and she started to panic. 
	
	
	Henry confused pulled the coin pouch hoping to prove claim to his family’s hard earned money.   The footman overpowered him and grabbed the pouch and in so doing, Henry shrunk back.  The footman glared with a rotting smile and coarse filthy face and swung the coin bag against the boys head.  Everyone including Mary was watching at the sound of it.    Henry’s voice let out one last "oooughmfffuggg, uh, uh".  One of the soldiers yelled at him: "Why did you do that?"  and they started arguing.  
	
	Mary and Elizabeth in their confusion didn’t place Henry with the sound of the commotion.  Through a clearing of the crowd, they suddenly spotted him.  Both let out screams of terror as they saw him rolling around on the floor rhythmically convulsing and vomiting.  Judith came in the room, looked towards Henry and let out a high pitched scream and for a moment, the room seemed to shudder.  She dashed between the footmen and the hurting young boy, and gave the attacking footman a look that made him turn pale, freezing stiff.  He fell back onto a few steps and braced a wall and started breathing heavily. His companions also stepped back. Judith watched helplessly, holding and comforting her son and clearing everything around him.  Everyone backed away and several townsfolk ran to get help.  Henry continued flailing weakly and suddenly collapsed, completely drained of his last fight for life.  She tried to shock him back and waved her hands over him.  Mary and Elizabeth came up at this time looking on in terror. "Come back Henry!" "Come back!" "Come back!"...Judith repeated over, soon joined by Elizabeth, Mary and John.  Judith’s friend had been tending her youngest.  John went to look for his father. A sergeant and captain strode in.  "What did you do!?" shouted the captain at the footman.  
	"A thief took our coins and refused to give them back so I took it from him."
	"What did you do to that boy!?"
	Judith looked at him and he started stammering. 
	"That boy was the thief who took our coin."
	Judith clenched her teeth "He was no thief." as she looked through each of them holding Henry in her arms not letting him go.  
	One of them spoke. "We had that coin purse when we sat down but it was not with us when we got up."
	Mary came forward very bravely as she was not accustomed to talking to adults like this at age ten: "Do you mean that pouch?"
	"Yes."
	"Not this one?" and she held up the look-alike that was her family’s and they all looked at one another..  
	"We sat down to eat together and if he took it, he couldn’t have taken it from you because he was with me the entire time. You left your at the table, I took ours when we got up so he must have taken yours….by mistake!"  
	
	Mary’s voice started to crack as she realized what was going on.  She felt as though she had caused Henry’s death right there since she had overzealously helped him by picking things up so he wouldn’t forget. If only she had left it there or let Henry take the one he brought in and sat down with, this wouldn’t have happened.  
	
	Everything that happened next was a blur of argument, pain, grief and exhaustion. When John Sr. came in, he bared his fists and beat the footman senseless. Her father was reprieved of any retribution for that given how he had lost a son.  The other man however was never seen on duty again.  John Sr. broke both his forearms during a long drawn out grapple on the floor and ripped his shoulder out of joint. Mary didn’t see it but wished she had later.  She wanted to see the man pay for what she did to Henry.  Mary couldn’t get the thought that Henry was now dead.  She had just barely finished grieving her grandfather and now she couldn’t grasp how a clever brother like Henry, so young, would suddenly be gone. Henry was buried next to two other graves….also twins who were older than Jack. (John Jr.)
	
	Mary rocked for days on her bed, never changing out of her nightgown, weeping for hours on end. She tried hard to recall Henry’s last words to her, she held tight to all her last memories with him and went over them, ruminating for hours.  Elizabeth was no better.  She fainted during her chores.   For a week, they barely spoke or even ate or produced much food….only going to the well for water and to the woods for firewood.  
	
	Viscount
	
	A few days later one rainy afternoon, Judith first heard a knock at the door.  She grabbed John to answer it.
	
	"Hello?"
	"I heard the sad news.  This is for you.".  He hands John Sr. a thin wood box.  As John opens it, he sees a large baked item that looks like cake or bread. 
	"Thank you, We could sure use this right now."
	
	
	The wet dark haired and lean but strong looking man who looked like he could be an uncle sat down before their fire.  
	
	"You know, I’ve been hoping you could join me at church next Sunday….St. John the Baptist church?"
	"Yes, we would be fair for that. "
	Judith nods to her husband.  
	"They say there might be a very dignified visitor there, the Viscount"
	"Then we will more surely be going there."
	"However, the main event will be the funeral service post mortem for your son.  I will count your intended presence there."
	
	Mary watched them from the corner of the room.  Father cut the bread into portions for the family and guest. Four large portions, a couple medium portions for Mary and Elizabeth and a small one for Thomas. Jacob would be getting his milk later that evening. 
	
	As Sunday came, a family of seven arrived. Sergeant Perkins, Judith and now five children all in hats and veils.  Before the stony chapel, a crew of stable boys was tending to a team of white horses.  The boys removed their hats with at their father’s lead.  The interior was ornate with incense filling the room.  The Parson there, in a gold vestment seemed even more gaudy than usual.  A friar was wandering the aisles. 
	"Greetings to the family of Sergeant Perkins.  The Lord Bless you in coming here this day."
	
	As they were seated, their expectations to be offered the Funeral Service from the Book of Common Prayer for Henry’s passing was quickly manifested.  Judith had brought her handkerchief with aromatics to revive her should she pass out and another to catch the weeping from her eyes. Judith’s sobbing could be heard over the hymns and psalms sung for Henry. 
	
	At the end of the funeral, a nobleman approached Judith, the same one she saw earlier and spoke in a soft elderly voice: 
	"I’m so sorry Good Sir, Dear Lady.  I originally planned to see family here this day but could not bear to do so with such great loss that so recently happened here and so here I am, in hopes of comforting you.", Sergeant Perkins straightened himself, as the Viscount of St. Alban looked at him ", here is something to help with your loss. "
	"I beg you, I cannot take it my Lord." replied Sergeant Perkins. 
	"I have to insist. I also have something writings here for you.  A copy of a tawdry play of mine, The New Atlantis, the new Holy Bible, some classic works and a treatise for all of us Strangers"
	A young squire stepped forward with a small wooden chest and handed it over to Sergeant Perkins.  It was heavier than he had supposed and tried to keep his posture and hold back a weak smile.  
	"Knowledge requires much strength, I know." he said with a smile.
	John Jr. gave a weak chuckle soon shared by all.  It had been a while since they had last laughed at anything.  The Viscount made stern his face as if worried his mirth might have been inappropriate at a time of mourning.  
	"I’ll have some victuals sent over to your home later." he said in a more serious tone.
	"May I have your lovely children’s names my dear?" he indicated at Judith, almost as if he already knew them and was just making a segue to talk with them. 
	"John, Elizabeth, Mary, Thomas and Jacob", was Judith’s matter of fact quick reply almost curious at this question herself given the message from earlier. 
	He casually asked each of them questions on their favorite sport and hobby but for Mary he made comment, "What a beautiful girl you are Mary, do you like to read?"
	"Yes my Lord, I can read all the signs in the pub"
	He chuckles, "Mannered, precocious, honest..."
	"Your mother isA red velvet curtain parted and a white billowing of vapours poured onto the stage.  Several of the audience members in the front gasped, scattered coughs were heard.  In the afternoon daylight, the sky seemed to dim accordingly.  Seven motionless faces peeked out of the fog which now filled the air in a thin haze. Tall figures in black shrowdes strode out in a dance to a slow and somber tune played by a small band of four players with cellos and bass violins.  They each were fitted with masques that bespoke of old hags. Noses and chins protruded thence whimsically painted with carmine lippy and rouge like the court mistresses and whores. 

"Judith, mine ears hath been heavy with rumours that a witch has stolen the children and eaten them.", spoke a raspy and masque muffled voice.

"Rubbish! Tis the old troll down the road who hath done this. The town folk dare not meet this fellow because he is wild and might slay them on sight though he takes much pain to eat for show and eats them in playne sight and otherwise lays about in idleness.  They look to us because we too play fools with life and death.  An we play the saviors this time, they will accuse us as before.  In due time I will make a pie of pork and hemlock to give him slumber and there we must all take him to the sea and cast him there.  Send forth for my familiar for he doth not answer my call this time."

A stuffed fur shaped into a cat and mounted on wheels made it’s way onto the stage seemingly by itself and fell over. 

"Mine familiar Asmodeus! Quicken thyself! " came a raspy falsetto. 
"Why dost thou not stir!?" 
"O woes and pains hath befallen me here  "
"As out of Magdalene went seven demons"
"Wherefore one not tarry here?"
"Nine years hast thou been suckled"
"Wherefore not portend to me this fate "
"And leaveth me with these dowdies?"
"Bridget, Hepsibah, Constance, Abigail, Mary, Anne, I give you license to depart."


"Judith, mother of crones, what desirest thou of thine daughters that we may not so soon hie off? Shall we feareth to abide with thee?"
"His soul hath swithly gone and thou needest our succor"

"Hepsibah, sister, his soul sleepeth before the fire."
"Wail not and fetch me a cistern and flint "
"Whereby we may take him unawares"
"Taketh thou dried moss of a bog, five old skins of a snake, a dram of moth-wing dust and 3 grains of a gnat’s liver"
"And bind these to a spell for him!"

One of the masqued robes brings out a cistern and vessels and hands it to another.  She stares wide creeping and stalking up on a point not seen and then she abruptly swings the open cistern as if it were made of paper in a wide arc over the imaginary point and lids it shut.  She leaps and twirls with delight.  A loud "Meow" comes from back stage and the crowd cheers.  They dance around the cistern and leap over it in turn.  As the band winds down, she hands it to the tallest one. 

"Mine familiar, tarry but a little longer with me!"   
Meowwwww.


She takes a vessel and takes off the lid in which is born a white powder.  She lights a small fire on a censer and places the cistern on it into which she then places the cat effigy.  The powder fills the air, fog rolls out again onto the stage and they dance around the fire.  As the cat has now been obscured, young stage hands sneak their hands into the cistern, taking out the effigy and replacing it with a real cat.  The tallest hag picks up the cat to pet it and proclaims:

"Asmodeus! Thou Fool!"
"From whence didst thou fall that thou wouldst force my hand to return thy soul?"

The cat meows loudly as if in response and she jolts upward as if startled and in awe.  The witches dance around again, tossing powder into the fire bringing flames that hurl ever higher towards the leaves.  Their vizards come off out of view as they round the fire, their faces younger and visibly male and gaunt but with girlish carmine stains on their cheeks and lips.  The music picks up and the crowd applauds the end of the scene and the act. 

John stands up in his sergeant's cape and sword in its scabbard about his waist.  His dark curly hair and bright blue eyes meet Judith’s dusty green eyes piercing his back with an air of dread.  Their children, their eyes wide and still affixed to the stage sit bolted in place.  They are: John Jr., a sixteen year old boy, with long curly light brown hair and blue eyes like his father’s, the twins, Elizabeth and Henry, both tow-headed with grey eyes at fourteen years and Mary, ten years old with long dark brown hair almost like her father’s.   Two younger siblings are missing this evening.  Judith looks back at the stage deep in thought:

The actors seem to have made a rather subtle gesture implicating her as a worker of the forbidden arts.  She would never make a pact with the Devil.  Was their use of her given name a coincidence in this small town?  She was the most widely known Judith in this town who could work the olde remedys.  There was only good in her working and it was nearly always efficacious.  

As people were rising from their seats, a gentleman in a collar and tall black hat came by and passed a slip of paper to Judith.  He winked at Judith and walked past with a retinue of two guards and three young ladies and a man dressed as a coach driver.  She opened the slip, her husband peering over her shoulder.  It’s Mary.  Watch her closely!

As she sat in the coming darkness of twilight, the guide who would take the audience to their various homes, came by with his torch and with that she arose in her husband’s arms to join her neighbors massing on the road and following the torch in the night.  While her feet were not as dainty as they once were, she could at least be spared the sprained ankles on the tiny feet of the town’s spritely, young maidens.  Those feet she could hear clacking over the stoney walk most of the walk home.  Some of these maidens had come out to theatre for their very first time and so she next wondered how many would be calling on her for a boneset plaster the next morning.

Butter

Mary Perkins, the ten year old daughter of John Sr. and Judith Perkins, with her pale skin, blush cheeks and black walnut hair woke up shivering, a thick quilt half covered her exposed arm out of her smock.  She stretched her cold arms, shivered and snuck back into bed pulling the covers taught over herself.

Looking over, Mary saw Elizabeth empty spot on the bed, a big mattress stuffed with wool flock, then Henry’s empty spot and then John’s spot which was now covered. Mary slept next to mom, next to her youngest brothers, Jacob and Thomas and then dad who slept on the end by the door.  Jacob and Thomas were swaddled up next to her, the last three remaining in bed. Did they let her sleep in today? Mary looked at the empty book that lay beside her.  I will write a page every day. 

She reached down to grab her overclothes and took up the milk pail to get outside and milk the family’s cow so she could get Jacob his breakfast.  On her way out, she grabbed some bread, dabbed it in some honey and butter and took the rest out with her on the way. She saw Elizabeth cutting wool to be spun later.  Mary was amazed how hard Elizabeth worked.  She had already finished scrubbing the clothes on the washboard and her hands were still fit for cutting the wool.   She could overhear Henry pleading with John:
"Please take me duck hunting!"
"Sorry Henry, you scared them all last time, I can’t take you if you want to eat game tonight."
"John, I promise I won’t spook them. Please?" 
Mom was tending the garden and dad was overseeing the farm hands.  

As Mary started to milk the cows she started to become entranced by the rhythm the milk made against the side of the pail.  She felt a little pricking on her neck like a fly.  She then felt a squirt to the face as Henry grabbed a nipple and squirted her down, the cow also taking alarm to the point Mary was afraid it might take it out on Henry but it didn’t.  She squirted him back, he opened his mouth to catch it and laughed.  Always the tease.  

"Do that and ye won’t fill your pail!"

Mary was quiet this time, trying to focus through getting her chore done.  She felt tired even though she was rested.  She pulled a foxtail out of the neck of her smock...Henry apparent was bored not being able to go hunting but it was only a matter of time before he would be made to clean stables.  Henry seemed to get away with it having Liza on his side.  The fields were full of cowslips, orchids, poppies and cornflowers and the cows were eating their fill making the pails extra heavy.  

There was now plenty of butter to make.  Mother was in the shade of the house by the hearthstone, working the dasher in the church.  Mary could hear the soft chant:


"Come butter come, come butter come, Peter stands at the gate, waiting for his buttered cake" 
Mary was tranced again but this time to the chant and the hand dropping the dasher with a twist in in rhythm to the kathunk-a-thunk-a-thunk of the churn.  It was a comforting sound she had heard since she was young.  She cradled Jacob in her lap and dipped milk out of the cup for him.  He’d swallow the milk to the same rhythm.  She’d feed her brothers while watching mom make butter.  Soon there would be sweet butter and buttermilk which would go into the cakes by evening.  Henry soon burst in with some wildflowers he picked on the way from the stable.  

"These be a fine batch Henry! I will save these marigolds and violets!.", Judith’s eyes brightened. 

Mary felt a scowl coming on but before it could come out, Judith turned to Mary with "So would you like to go visit grandpa?"  Mary’s heart leaped in delight.  She would give anything to take a break from the hot afternoon with the cows again.  

"Oh we must go!"   
"Then let’s get into our finery and out of these work rags...but after you help me finish the butter!"
"Henry, a Firkin!"

Within a few minutes, Henry brought in a smaller dark peat colored firkin that looks like it had many fillings of butter.  He gripped its lid attempting to free it from its vessel, but after a few puzzled looks, heaves and face reddened tries, he let out a long sigh: "It’s sealed too tight!".  

Judith broke mid-churn to find a needle tipped wand from the table.  Being a cunning woman in Hilmorton and more well known than even she knew, she often had a curious and never-seen-before solutions to these odd little problems. She ordered, "Put it down in the center Henry and come over here!"  Henry put it down and Judith held out her hand, just barely touching the firkin.  She uttered the words as if she were calling out for someone named "Albertus" and then stopped.  Nothing. 

A second later, Mary yawned, right into the base end of Judith’s wand and as soon as her ear popped, a great pop came from the firkin and the lid of it’s own accord hopped to the sound now loose.  Henry was now simply able to grasp the lid right off.  Judith smiled at Mary and Henry and Henry, after a moment of being awestruck, went to hand the firkin to mom as she pulled them into hug them and gave a "Blessed Mary!"  Mary smiled, feeling more recognized than she was used to and remembering just how unique and unusual her mother was compared to most.   After the butter making business was all put away, Judith called everyone in to wash and don their finest for grandpa Michael Gater, Judith’s father.

Michael

They step off the road, Judith carrying her one year old babe with her strong arms and onto a beautiful wildflower spritzed greenery which was thick with fluff, bees and butterflies.  A maypole stood to the side recently decked with bouquets of flowers and ribbons.

Mom: "Father!"
Kids in turn: "Grandpa!"
Michael: "Judith, it’s been so long, your children are half grown!  "
Judith: "Oh father, I was just here last week bringing you eggs and butter! "
Michael: grins "Good son John, Come in and pray tell me what you’ve grown this year."
They all enter, Judith has brought eggs and butter. 
Judith: "I brought you some sweet butter lacking the salt."

Michael eats some bread and butter. He takes them all out back to see his yard. Mary shows interest. The kids all play outside.  John is taking Henry through the woods.  Elizabeth is home with the babies. Judith is working on a supper.  Michael’s house is big and nice.  Michael has a big herb garden….Mary is amazed at the flowers and herbs there. 

Judith: "Mary, would you like to stay here and help grandpa?"
Mary: "I would most enjoy it mother. Thank you."

Michael: "That one there is Lavender.  Mary my dear little lady, would you help me pick some of the flowers?"

Foxglove, Wolfsbane, Comfrey, Lavender

"I can make a salve that can heal scrapes with that one."
"I’m going to teach you a technique for making the salve called enfleurage"
"First you must flatten the butter and I like to melt it in the sun and then take it into the cool room"  
"While it’s still melted, put all the flower petals in the butter"
"Now we’ll roll it around into a ball, knead it around. "
"Won’t I get them greasy?" 
"Wet your hands in the water first and it won’t be so bad."
"That’s the way."



"Now let’s melt it again in the sun and drain it through the cloth and into the second dish"
"Pick some more flowers for me will you?"
"Wonderful Mary, let’s do this a couple more times".

Michael showed Mary how to make a violet flavored honey for coughs, a yarrow and mugwort  tincture for toothaches and fits and a comfrey and mint tea for broken bones.  He smiled brightly and for a moment his face seemed about as young as her older brother Henry’s despite being sixty years in age. 

They went out to the tomatoes and he showed her how to pollinate the tomatoes, how to make a compost tea and showed her a beehive that helped to make honey.  He got a still of grain alcohol that he used to make the tincture. (history check).  She asked him why her strawberries didn’t grow...he told her that different plants take to different soils.  Strawberries like the sandy kind.

Mary goes back home and shows all the wonderful stuff she made in little pots.

"Elizabeth, I had such a wonderful time, I learned so much, I have to tell you about the flower butter I made!"

Elizabeth gives a stern look and throws a rag at Mary.  "Want to know what I did all week?"  
She points at a pile of pots.


Mary stares at the pot that Elizabeth pointed at and one falls down and breaks.  Henry comes in looking a little shocked but also like it’s not surprising.  Elizabeth ignored it as if to assume Mary might have brushed it and knocked it over, already somewhat blinded by her anger.  Elizabeth stomps with "Oooooh! You clumsy fool!" and throws down a broom and stomps off.  Mary begins to sob...walks slowly to the broom and starts to sweep.  Henry approaches Mary and puts his arm around her.  
"It’s not your fault, she’s been like this all week. "

Mary stopped sobbing but was still blush in the face and was aching in the pit of her stomach. As she looks up at Henry, she looks as if she would break into sobs again.  

"Please don’t Mary… Elizabeth drops things herself sometimes.  You know, sometimes, it’s meant to be.  Little accidents make life interesting.  Who knows, maybe it is our Lord’s greater purpose to keep us well by not having us eat from old dishes...maybe.  Or maybe it would have later fell on my toe!  So thank you Mary, thank you for saving my big toe!"
"Mary, I got to go to grandpa’s last year too and he taught me a few of those things. Did he show you how to make the anise and mint liqueur or the dandelion wine?"
"Not yet"
"Tell me everything he taught you."
"Well, we made a wonderful violet cough honey. It’s almost like candy, I had snuck a taste and it’s so sweet like a flower nectar."  
"Oh, now he didn’t tell me that.  He didn’t let me drink any of it the stuff we made...said it had to be for pains and ailments or for when I got older and wanted a good tonic."
Mary hugs Henry.
"Thank you Henry."
"Any time you want someone to talk to, I’m here for you.  You mustn’t forget it!"

Mary thought a little better of Henry from that time forward.  It was only the following week that mom went to look for Michael and he had been laying in his chair, quiet and breathing shallow and in a raspy note.  Judith stayed by him all the night watching over him and making sure he was kept warm with freshly warmed stones from the hearth...she tried to feed him but he simply brushed it weakly aside.  It wasn’t but an hour later that he stopped breathing altogether. 

When Judith returned, Mary heard the news of grandpa’s death and cried in her mom’s arms.  Mom took the long white apron from the front of her skirt and wiped Mary’s tears and patted her cheeks dry.  Michael was the only grandparent she knew and death of someone she knew was a new experience to her.  Her father went out with the boys to bury his father in law and hold a wake there.


Isabel

Next day, Judith and Mary had both been given the day to mourn and the men of the family did much of their work.  Judith chanted the butter tune mournfully and slowly this time.  She’d look over at Mary and they both held a tear in their eye as they woefully exchanged sympathetic glances. As dusk soon arrived, Judith pulled herself up and put on her cloak.  

"Mary, I’m going to take you to our kin’s land"

With that, she took out Mary’s cloak and they both went out.  Elizabeth was still tending to the babies that day, also in mourning, veiling her face. 

Outside the door Judith told her "Elizabeth’s been out earlier today laying flowers on all the graves, and praying to the good Lord if he would send them to find papa". 

"This is where mama is buried. " 

Isabel Baylie was written on the tombstone.  
A gale of wind came through and rocked the tree branches making a few twig snaps and creaks like the beams in a stony church.  The dusk was now at its dimmest and the night fall within the hour.  A green orb gently grew, floating above the other headstones and trees, a will-o-the-wisp.  Judith seemed to take it fairly seriously as a sign.  To Mary, these were common to the marshlands and while she may have seen one from a distance before, she never saw one up close.  Judith broke out with verse:


The Master is here.
And long would I tarry
But I open my cove
By St. Peter and Mary

A tap on the tree with a stick produced a very curious motion.  Immediately, the vines parted over what now appeared to be a natural tree hollow archway that led into a cellar built into the cool north face of the hill.  

"Come with me Mary"

Inside this cellar was a wall of masonry.  It was like a small mausoleum and a laboratory where a single casket lay and built in shelves of bottles lined most of one wall and a wall of skulls partially filled another.  Mary held onto dear breath as she beheld it’s marvel.  

Her mom guided her by the arm to a chair and table in the middle of the room.  

"Today, I will share with you what my mother shared with me."
"You will carry forward the wisdom of the wives, continue our tales and our trade"
"I do not ask an oath but as we are surrounded here by our mothers, what we say here will be binding. Are you willing to stay?"
"Yes mother."

"I reveal to you now that I am both your mother and your Queen.  A child’s loyalty is naturally to their mother first.  This has not changed but has only become more sure.  Your blood is precious and royal.  You are an heir princess. Please, talk and ask me anything you wish freely."

"So if I am a princess, who will be my subjects?"

"But we are not the Queens of this land.  No, we are the Queens of something greater, a hidden kingdom that is as invisible as air and thought.  The Realm of Wisdom, the crowning jewel of all mental powers. Many girls are gifted but you will be their ruler.  If you cannot rule in force, then you will rule in influence and suggestion. Essentially, you will rule others without them knowing they are being ruled." 

"Who can I tell?"

"You cannot tell anyone.  We rule for power in ideas over glory.  You will write books and your readers will be your court.   You may pass this secret on to your daughter, any fair-not-handsome son you have, and as a last resort, your most kindred in spirit who has manifested a gift.. I will give to you learning and tests in the arts of healing, charm, reading and writing, consultation with the spirits, both your ancestors and the dead of others. You will work miracle...some that are understood and that are not.  Some will call you a demon and some will call you an angel, a witch, or a good wife. Do not boast of yourself and call yourself anything. Let your virtues be your only title. "

Judith lit a fire in a fireplace in the dark with what seemed to be a mere snap of the fingers.  Did she know some formula for fire or was she so powerful that she could summon instant fire?  The cold started to slowly fade into warmth and light. 

"You can have great influence even without fame.  Protect your name and your power with the strongest of shields and that is secrecy. To have power is to be free.  To be free, you cannot be in debt of mind to dogmas.  You cannot be in debit to the gaoler by doing someone harm.  You shall not act against their will and in so doing cause a rebellion against you.  You will not contest their idea of their deity.  It is futile.  Do no harm to yourself.  Do all you can to survive and continue.  Subject yourself to no one other than your mother and your conscience, and do not borrow unless not doing so would cause you to commit act against the former. You may worship what you may and be loyal to your own dearest spirit or deity but to not enslave yourself to church or kingdom except it be to respect the wishes that do not contest your own or to avoid being discovered.  You may follow their just intentions.  You can appear to be theirs.  You can serve your fellows but only after you serve your future generation.  While you don’t have to subject yourself to them, it is your duty to serve and influence and in so doing have power and magic on your side.  Set trends, whisper and listen wherever you go."  

Judith paused to breath: "First, I give you your magic wand.  You can create anything you want with this."

"How can I do that?"

"Just believe me, it will come to you.  Your first test of magic is to summon a bird.  The best bird you can."  Judith handed Mary a pencil.  Mary suddenly realized what was expected.  She had watched mom draw before.  Mary took the pencil and sketched a bird.  Judith lit a candle and left her there to draw.  Mary finished sketching but then noticed her mother had left.  For a moment, Mary thought her mom might have just vanished or flew up the chimney given what she just saw.  Mary started to get scared but she waited patiently.  Mary couldn’t tell if it was day or night after a while.  Mary had drawn a blue jay. In the passing hours, Mary took time to perfect her drawing in little details. After she finished drawing, she slept at the table.  When she awoke, Judith had returned.

"This looks very nice.  I am not judging you solely on talent.  You can tell a lot about a person by how they draw a simple image of a bird.  This is beautiful Mary.  You’ve surpassed my expectations and I can see now what you can do Mary and I will help you master it.  I give you the name Corinna.  It means you are a Raven and a Queen raven is to a king like a dragon is to a catfish.  You can do what your heart speaks with this gift and you can fly into the night."


Judith put her hand on the door and held it there as she cautioned Mary:

"Tell no one of this place, use it only when you need to escape but let none follow you here.  In that case, lead them to their own danger.  If anything befalls this place, it is up to you to make another like it and at least as hidden if you can manage it."

Mary smiled.  She heard some birds chirping at that point and looked about and saw that early dawn light was starting to break through where they had entered late at dusk.  As Mary emerged, the world seemed brighter, happier somehow.  

Stew

Being that it was the height of summer, the Perkins children were starting to get dull and feel some effects of cabin fever.  In Hilmorton there were a few taverns where Sergeant John Perkins went.  John would occasionally see a family stop to eat at these but  not stay in overnight.  John handed Judith a purse and said, 

"Take the children out to one of the ordinaries on the main road and let them eat whatever they want. "

Judith realized she’d need to pack for her tots there.  There were occasionally women who even breastfeed or found wet nurses at the ordinaries. Always a lot of activity there, there would be some items to take to the trading post.  Her husband often guarded these to ensure there was no troubles from drunkenness or theft there.  The family often went there together and settled by other ladies and their husbands to avoid being near the bar area where courting and drinking occurred.  Soon enough, they arrived at the public gathering house to make rounds, say hellos and sell the items they could sell to the merchant there who would resell it for a profit. Judith took Thomas and Jacob with her to chat with a mother who had just had her first child.  John, seeing some of his friends left to chat with them and left the money bag with Henry.  Elizabeth, Henry and Mary took a corner table all to themselves.  Henry ordered a plate of stew and a pot of ale.  Elizabeth and Mary were quiet and Henry passed a look to Elizabeth.

"Mary, I’m sorry I was cross with you.", spoke Elizabeth.  
"I am sorry…" started Mary
"No, don’t apologize little sister, I searched my heart and found jealousy towards you.  It is my sin.  I should be more stalwart as your older sister to check my heart when it comes to what you receive.  I usually receive those things first before you.  I was not wise to forget that.  My melancholy and pains have been working on me. Forgive me?"
Henry smiled and nodded at Mary. 
"Yes, of course.  You’re my older sister and I do all in my power to be true to you and share all I have with you."  Mary thought back to her night in the cove.  She didn’t know if Elizabeth knew all this or not.  They had not had any instruction on what they could discuss with each other. 
"I think I know how you’re feeling Mary.  I know you have gifts of the spirits"
"Elizabeth, can we speak of such here?"
"Oh, I was not going to say much more little sister. Don’t fret."
"Dinner is served!" announced the bar keeper. With that, a large plate steaming with hot brown gravies, smelling like a Christmas roast came out.  Cooked beets, rutabagas and carrots glistened among the chunks of meat."
Mary’s eyes were much bigger than her stomach but over the course of the hour, the three of them finished every last bit. Just before they left, they noticed some footmen storm into the dining area.  Mary over heard one: I’ll be hanging in chains if I don’t find it immediately!  Another: I swore it was right here!  Another: Some pick pocket’s unlucky day just arrived.     


Henry was lazily leaving the table.  Mary grabbed the Perkin’s coin pouch and with Elizabeth, ran ahead to meet mother at the door.  Out of Mary’s sight, Henry grabbed another similar looking coin pouch on the wood backed benches they sat in.  Henry lagged behind a little so as they were leaving, one of the soldiers pointed to Henry’s pouch shouting in a peasant voice: 
"I caught him the little cutpurse!".  Mary looked around not finding Henry, the soldiers were blocking her view and she started to panic. 


Henry confused pulled the coin pouch hoping to prove claim to his family’s hard earned money.   The footman overpowered him and grabbed the pouch and in so doing, Henry shrunk back.  The footman glared with a rotting smile and coarse filthy face and swung the coin bag against the boys head.  Everyone including Mary was watching at the sound of it.    Henry’s voice let out one last "oooughmfffuggg, uh, uh".  One of the soldiers yelled at him: "Why did you do that?"  and they started arguing.  

Mary and Elizabeth in their confusion didn’t place Henry with the sound of the commotion.  Through a clearing of the crowd, they suddenly spotted him.  Both let out screams of terror as they saw him rolling around on the floor rhythmically convulsing and vomiting.  Judith came in the room, looked towards Henry and let out a high pitched scream and for a moment, the room seemed to shudder.  She dashed between the footmen and the hurting young boy, and gave the attacking footman a look that made him turn pale, freezing stiff.  He fell back onto a few steps and braced a wall and started breathing heavily. His companions also stepped back. Judith watched helplessly, holding and comforting her son and clearing everything around him.  Everyone backed away and several townsfolk ran to get help.  Henry continued flailing weakly and suddenly collapsed, completely drained of his last fight for life.  She tried to shock him back and waved her hands over him.  Mary and Elizabeth came up at this time looking on in terror. "Come back Henry!" "Come back!" "Come back!"...Judith repeated over, soon joined by Elizabeth, Mary and John.  Judith’s friend had been tending her youngest.  John went to look for his father. A sergeant and captain strode in.  "What did you do!?" shouted the captain at the footman.  
"A thief took our coins and refused to give them back so I took it from him."
"What did you do to that boy!?"
Judith looked at him and he started stammering. 
"That boy was the thief who took our coin."
Judith clenched her teeth "He was no thief." as she looked through each of them holding Henry in her arms not letting him go.  
One of them spoke. "We had that coin purse when we sat down but it was not with us when we got up."
Mary came forward very bravely as she was not accustomed to talking to adults like this at age ten: "Do you mean that pouch?"
"Yes."
"Not this one?" and she held up the look-alike that was her family’s and they all looked at one another..  
"We sat down to eat together and if he took it, he couldn’t have taken it from you because he was with me the entire time. You left your at the table, I took ours when we got up so he must have taken yours….by mistake!"  

Mary’s voice started to crack as she realized what was going on.  She felt as though she had caused Henry’s death right there since she had overzealously helped him by picking things up so he wouldn’t forget. If only she had left it there or let Henry take the one he brought in and sat down with, this wouldn’t have happened.  

Everything that happened next was a blur of argument, pain, grief and exhaustion. When John Sr. came in, he bared his fists and beat the footman senseless. Her father was reprieved of any retribution for that given how he had lost a son.  The other man however was never seen on duty again.  John Sr. broke both his forearms during a long drawn out grapple on the floor and ripped his shoulder out of joint. Mary didn’t see it but wished she had later.  She wanted to see the man pay for what she did to Henry.  Mary couldn’t get the thought that Henry was now dead.  She had just barely finished grieving her grandfather and now she couldn’t grasp how a clever brother like Henry, so young, would suddenly be gone. Henry was buried next to two other graves….also twins who were older than Jack. (John Jr.)

Mary rocked for days on her bed, never changing out of her nightgown, weeping for hours on end. She tried hard to recall Henry’s last words to her, she held tight to all her last memories with him and went over them, ruminating for hours.  Elizabeth was no better.  She fainted during her chores.   For a week, they barely spoke or even ate or produced much food….only going to the well for water and to the woods for firewood.  

Viscount

A few days later one rainy afternoon, Judith first heard a knock at the door.  She grabbed John to answer it.

"Hello?"
"I heard the sad news.  This is for you.".  He hands John Sr. a thin wood box.  As John opens it, he sees a large baked item that looks like cake or bread. 
"Thank you, We could sure use this right now."


The wet dark haired and lean but strong looking man who looked like he could be an uncle sat down before their fire.  

"You know, I’ve been hoping you could join me at church next Sunday….St. John the Baptist church?"
"Yes, we would be fair for that. "
Judith nods to her husband.  
"They say there might be a very dignified visitor there, the Viscount"
"Then we will more surely be going there."
"However, the main event will be the funeral service post mortem for your son.  I will count your intended presence there."

Mary watched them from the corner of the room.  Father cut the bread into portions for the family and guest. Four large portions, a couple medium portions for Mary and Elizabeth and a small one for Thomas. Jacob would be getting his milk later that evening. 

As Sunday came, a family of seven arrived. Sergeant Perkins, Judith and now five children all in hats and veils.  Before the stony chapel, a crew of stable boys was tending to a team of white horses.  The boys removed their hats with at their father’s lead.  The interior was ornate with incense filling the room.  The Parson there, in a gold vestment seemed even more gaudy than usual.  A friar was wandering the aisles. 
"Greetings to the family of Sergeant Perkins.  The Lord Bless you in coming here this day."

As they were seated, their expectations to be offered the Funeral Service from the Book of Common Prayer for Henry’s passing was quickly manifested.  Judith had brought her handkerchief with aromatics to revive her should she pass out and another to catch the weeping from her eyes. Judith’s sobbing could be heard over the hymns and psalms sung for Henry. 

At the end of the funeral, a nobleman approached Judith, the same one she saw earlier and spoke in a soft elderly voice: 
"I’m so sorry Good Sir, Dear Lady.  I originally planned to see family here this day but could not bear to do so with such great loss that so recently happened here and so here I am, in hopes of comforting you.", Sergeant Perkins straightened himself, as the Viscount of St. Alban looked at him ", here is something to help with your loss. "
"I beg you, I cannot take it my Lord." replied Sergeant Perkins. 
"I have to insist. I also have something writings here for you.  A copy of a tawdry play of mine, The New Atlantis, the new Holy Bible, some classic works and a treatise for all of us Strangers"
A young squire stepped forward with a small wooden chest and handed it over to Sergeant Perkins.  It was heavier than he had supposed and tried to keep his posture and hold back a weak smile.  
"Knowledge requires much strength, I know." he said with a smile.
John Jr. gave a weak chuckle soon shared by all.  It had been a while since they had last laughed at anything.  The Viscount made stern his face as if worried his mirth might have been inappropriate at a time of mourning.  
"I’ll have some victuals sent over to your home later." he said in a more serious tone.
"May I have your lovely children’s names my dear?" he indicated at Judith, almost as if he already knew them and was just making a segue to talk with them. 
"John, Elizabeth, Mary, Thomas and Jacob", was Judith’s matter of fact quick reply almost curious at this question herself given the message from earlier. 
He casually asked each of them questions on their favorite sport and hobby but for Mary he made comment, "What a beautiful girl you are Mary, do you like to read?"
"Yes my Lord, I can read all the signs in the pub"
He chuckles, "Mannered, precocious, honest..."
"Your mother is a very smart Lady, and you are so much like your mother Mary.  Your sister is also very patient and in that there is much wisdom.  You’re in good hands, you’ll be looking after them as they look after you."
Judith hands him a piece of paper. Mary thinks she sees the sketch of the bird she drew.  As he looked it over, he looked at Mary and smiled again and spoke a little more:
"Any time you need some helpful reading, take a look at the little book with the cross on it."
He drew his hand over his eye to look at the sun on the horizon and with a sigh.  
"It would be time to go!" and with that, his entourage gathered around him and whisked him away as almost if he rested on a cloud of velvet caps which is men in waiting wore. The sound of the white horses whinnied in the background and soon his coach was seen stirring up the dust over the greens of the valley. 

When they got home, Judith cracked open the box very eagerly.  She spied a book labeled Cicero, The New Atlantis, The Holy Bible, Hamlet, The Tiller then the mysterious little book with the cross on it.  She cracked it open.  The initials R.C. appeared on it.  There were alchemical pictures and a series of seventy and fifty spells in Latin each with prologues and epilogues. There was a list of scientific laws and then this creed:
Love God above all.
Devote your time to your spiritual advancement
Be entirely unselfish
Be temperate, modest, energetic, and silent
Learn to know the origins of the metals contained within thyself
Beware of quacks and pretenders
Live in constant adoration of the highest good
Learn the theory before you attempt the practice
Exercise charity towards all beings
Read the ancient books of wisdom
Try to understand their secret meaning.

Below that was a penned passage:    To Mary, I hope this serves you well.  F.B.

In the bottom corner of the box they received was a tiny stained wooden box with checker patterns on it looking like alabaster and ivory.  On it was a family crest with a red shield, chiefed in white with two pierced black stars crested with a boar passant in blue ermine.  It was the most ornate little box any of them had laid eyes on.  A little string and a note was attached the lip of the box.  As Judith picked up the box and read the note, her eyes widened and her mouth dropped, her eyes moving back and forth rapidly which indicated to everyone she was reading and then re-reading being it was such a small note. Her expression diminishing stare seemed to depict fear more than hope.
