1	1	1	1	A red velvet curtain parted and a billowing of white smoke poured onto the stage.	81
1	1	2	1	Several of the audience members in the front gasped, scattered coughs were heard.  	83
1	1	2	2	At least two hundred audience members, their hats and bonnets shading them from sun and rain, sat before an open air theatre in the little town of Hilmorton to watch the latest masqued play. 	191
1	1	2	3	As the smoke continued to pour, the sky had also seemed to dim accordingly. 	76
1	1	2	4	Seven motionless faces peeked out of the fog which now filled the air in a thin haze where the curtains were. 	110
1	1	2	5	Tall figures in black shrowdes strode out in a dance to a slow and somber tune played by a small band of four players with cellos and bass violins. 	148
1	1	2	6	The figures were each fitted with masques that bespoke of old hags. 	68
1	1	2	7	Noses and chins protruded thence whimsically painted with carmine lippy and rouge like the court mistresses and whores.	119
1	1	3	1	“Judith, mine ears hast been heavy with rumours that a witch has stolen the children and eaten them.”, spoke a raspy and masque muffled voice.	142
1	1	4	1	“Rubbish! 	10
1	1	4	2	Tis the old troll down the road who hath done this. 	52
1	1	4	3	The town folk dare not meet this fellow because he is wild and might slay them on sight though he takes much pain to eat for show and eats them in playne sight and otherwise lays about in idleness. 	198
1	1	4	4	They look to us because we too play fools with life and death. 	63
1	1	4	5	An we play the saviors this time, they will accuse us as before. 	65
1	1	4	6	In due time I will make a pie of pork and hemlock to give him slumber and there we must all take him to the sea and cast him there. 	132
1	1	4	7	Send forth for my familiar for he doth not answer my call this time.”	69
1	1	5	1	A stuffed fur shaped into a cat and mounted on wheels made its way onto the stage seemingly by itself and fell over.	116
1	1	6	1	“Mine familiar, Asmodeus! 	26
1	1	6	2	Quicken thyself! 	17
1	1	6	3	” said Judith the head witch in a raspy falsetto, “Why dost thou not stir!?  	77
1	1	6	4	O woes and pains hath befallen me here. 	40
1	1	6	5	As out of Magdalene went seven demons. 	39
1	1	6	6	Wherefore one not tarry here?  	31
1	1	6	7	Nine years hast thou been suckled. 	35
1	1	6	8	Wherewith didst thou portend to me this fate?  	47
1	1	6	9	And leaveth me with these dowdies?  	36
1	1	6	10	Bridget, Hepsibah, Constance, Abigail, Mary, Anne, I give you license to depart.”	81
1	1	7	1	One of the dark cloaks stepped out to speak, “Judith, mother of crones, what desirest thou of thine daughters that we may not so soon hie off? 	143
1	1	7	2	Shall we feareth to abide with thee?”	37
1	1	8	1	“His soul hath swithly gone and thou needest our succor,” came another voice amongst the cloaks.	96
1	1	9	1	“Hepsibah, sister, his soul sleepeth before the fire,” croaked a rotund matron as she stepped forward. 	103
1	1	9	2	“Wail not and fetch me a cistern and flint!  	45
1	1	9	3	Whereby we may take him unawares. 	34
1	1	9	4	Taketh thou dried moss of a moor, five old skins of a snake, a dram of moth-wing dust and three grains of a gnat’s liver,” she said pointing around. 	149
1	1	9	5	“And bind these to a spell for him!”	36
1	1	10	1	One of the masqued robes brought out a cistern and vessels and handed it to another. 	85
1	1	10	2	She stared wide creeping and stalking up on a point not seen and then she abruptly swung the open cistern as if it were made of paper in a wide arc over the imaginary point and lidded it shut. 	193
1	1	10	3	She leapt and twirled with delight. 	36
1	1	10	4	A loud “Meow” came from backstage as the crowd cheered. 	56
1	1	10	5	They danced around the cistern and leapt over it in turn. 	58
1	1	10	6	As the band winded down, she handed it to mother Judith uttering loudly for all to hear, “Mine familiar, tarry but a little longer with me!”	140
1	1	11	1	A deep meow, almost a yowl came from the stage as if from a phantom there.	74
1	1	12	1	She grabbed the vessel and took off the lid.  	46
1	1	12	2	Inside the vessel was a white powder. 	38
1	1	12	3	She lit a small fire in the censer and placed the cistern on it into which she then placed the cat effigy. 	107
1	1	12	4	The fire exploded in a burst of sparks causing shrieks and awes and the actors themselves were startled.  	106
1	1	12	5	One fell over while others looked around at each other. 	56
1	1	12	6	Laughter filled the air as the one who fell struggled in his skirts to climb to his feet. 	90
1	1	12	7	The burning powder filled the air and fog rolled out again onto the stage. 	75
1	1	12	8	They danced round about the fire laughing and cackling gleefully. 	66
1	1	12	9	As the cat was now obscured, young stage hands reached into the cistern and took out the effigy and replaced it with a live cat. 	129
1	1	12	10	The tallest hag picked up the cat before it could get away and pet it assuringly before proclaiming:	100
1	1	13	1	“Asmodeus! 	11
1	1	13	2	Thou Fool! 	11
1	1	13	3	From whence didst thou fall that thou wouldst force my hand to return thy soul?” 	81
1	1	13	4	said Judith, mother of crones.	30
1	1	14	1	The cat meowed loudly as if in response and she jolted upward feigning being startled and in awe. 	98
1	1	14	2	The witches danced around again, tossing powder into the fire bringing flames that licked ever higher towards the leaves. 	122
1	1	14	3	Their vizards came off out of view as they continued to dance around the fire, their faces younger and visibly male and gaunt but with girlish carmine stains remaining on their lips. 	183
1	1	14	4	The music picked up and the crowd applauded the end of the scene and act.	73
1	1	15	1	Nauseating scents of stinging stage smoke, mildewed cobblestones, wet tobacco and rotting meat thickened the air around the audience seats. 	140
1	1	15	2	Further down, the streets were lined with vendors. 	51
1	1	15	3	The array of rolling carts with their wares hanging with sausage links, smoke-cured meats and packing their carts. 	115
1	1	15	4	Bells and voices babbled through mists seeping from the wet streets that were recently dampened with spring rains. 	115
1	1	15	5	The sky was overcast and slowly dimming to a hiding sun. 	57
1	1	15	6	The air was cool and still.	27
1	1	16	1	In the back of the theatre’s seating, one of the sergeants was there tripling his duties as father, theatre patron and keeper of the peace. 	140
1	1	16	2	His entourage was last to leave the stands. 	44
1	1	16	3	John Perkins Sr. finally stood up unfurling a black wooly sergeant's cape and sword tucked into a brown hard leather scabbard, strapped about his waist. 	153
1	1	16	4	His cheeks were dimpled as well as his chin. 	45
1	1	16	5	His dark curly hair and bright blue eyes meet his wife Judith’s dusty green eyes piercing his back with an air of dread. 	121
1	1	16	6	John Sr. looked around to count the heads of his children. 	59
1	1	16	7	He looked back at his darling of a wife, her hair in sandy ringlets and tied up under a sun hat with a ribbon tying it down and resting under her chin.  	153
1	1	16	8	She took the cue to double check the count with him. 	53
1	1	16	9	After they both peered out over the crowds, their eyes met again at the same time with John Sr. finally asking, “Where is that boy?”	132
1	1	17	1	Judith’s brow furrowed and squinted as she held a hand up over her eyes. 	73
1	1	17	2	She had four children with her earlier but now three. 	54
1	1	17	3	There were two more at home with a governess. 	46
1	1	17	4	Judith wore a lot of face powder and color compared to most.  	62
1	1	17	5	She was fond of her earrings and necklaces despite the fact she was considered by most such a God fearing woman “once you got to be familiar with her.”  	153
1	1	17	6	However, there were a few who considered her a strange and miraculous woman “once you start to do business with her.”	117
1	1	18	1	“Mother, I think he’s back there somewhere,” pointed out Elizabeth or Lizzie, the oldest girl, almost towheaded with grey eyes and fourteen years old. 	151
1	1	18	2	Lizzie and Henry were twins and while both of them thought Judith was overprotective, Lizzie would get annoyed when Henry went missing. 	136
1	1	18	3	Even so, she had a knack of knowing where he was.	49
1	1	19	1	John Jr, or Johnny was the oldest son. 	39
1	1	19	2	At sixteen, he was now as tall as his father, and with his face a younger version of father’s as well, people started to confuse the two when John Sr. was not in uniform or when they both wore hats.  	200
1	1	19	3	Johnny’s hair was longer and sun-bleached into light brown locks just lighter than his mother’s and just barely curled at his shoulders.  	138
1	1	19	4	He asked an older boy sitting next to him who he knew from school, “Willy, have you seen my brother Henry?” 	108
1	1	19	5	to which the pallid and long-faced boy shook his head.  	56
1	1	19	6	He walked out onto the grass and weaved through the crowds.	59
1	1	20	1	Mary, the youngest of their four children was ten years old and had long dark walnut-brown hair and deep green eyes like her mother’s.  	136
1	1	20	2	She saw Elizabeth, or “Lizzie” for short turn around and walk straight back to the rear of the audience section and disappear. 	127
1	1	20	3	Judith looked down at Mary who was now already starting to follow Lizzie’s trail to the rear section.  	103
1	1	20	4	As Mary weaved around the crowds, she pushed aside several large fluffy dresses carefully looking for the familiar blue skirt that Lizzie wore.  	145
1	1	20	5	Finally reaching the back, she saw Henry dancing at a clearing.  	65
1	1	20	6	He looked unusually like his sister but with much shorter blonde hair.  	72
1	1	20	7	They both had those cherub like cheeks to match their often frowned upon, and hence secretive, joviality.  	107
1	1	20	8	Lizzie was watching him giggling.  	35
1	1	20	9	His dance parody was an outlandish version of the dances they just saw on stage. 	81
1	1	20	10	He hopped on one foot and onto the other with a big sweeping step and made a creaky voice of an elderly woman to which people burst into uproar. 	145
1	1	20	11	The crowds cleared further away from him forming a circle around him, now including Lizzie who she soon spotted to her right seeing her by her light hair but otherwise concealed amongst the mass of skirts.  	207
1	1	20	12	Lizzie spotted Mary back quickly and changed her demeanor from one of mirth to a serious, miniature mommy one.  	112
1	1	20	13	Lizzie walked past Henry and snagged his collar turning him about to where Mary was.	84
1	1	21	1	“You mustn’t follow me out here!  	34
1	1	21	2	What if you got lost?”	22
1	1	22	1	“I thought we were looking for him.”	36
1	1	23	1	“Yes, and I was just about to bring him back!”	46
1	1	24	1	Lizzie knew that Mary would say just enough to not let her get away with just standing there watching so the three of them marched back through the ruffles and tailcoats to where they could see mother, father and Johnny.	220
1	1	25	1	Mary was worried that Henry might offend one of the dancers if they accidentally spied him out.  	97
1	1	25	2	She gulped down the impending feeling of trouble brewing that Henry seemed to cause regularly.  	96
1	1	25	3	Mary stomped angrily at how she saw Lizzie there.  	51
1	1	25	4	Mary was sensitive to Lizzie’s double standards and a bit unaware as to how prevalent double standards were.  	110
1	1	25	5	Mary could never bring herself to do that.  	44
1	1	25	6	Her conscience would bite her too hard. 	40
1	1	25	7	She sighed to herself feeling completely alone in having such a strict guide stuck in her head.  	97
1	1	25	8	Part of her secretly wished she could be more like Lizzie.	58
1	1	26	1	“Henry, what did I tell you before we got here?” 	49
1	1	26	2	piped his angry father.  	25
1	1	26	3	John Sr. brought his hand around to Henry’s backside to give it a firm whack.  	79
1	1	26	4	Henry winced mid-smile.	23
1	1	27	1	Henry enjoyed the attention better than his brother Johnny did but knew not to press his luck with father so he gave a sincere sounding “Oww!” 	143
1	1	27	2	with just enough protest to convince that he got the message.	61
1	1	28	1	“Johnny, we found Henry!” 	26
1	1	28	2	shouted John Sr.	16
1	1	29	1	Judith looked back at the stage deep in thought. 	49
1	1	29	2	She played the sound of her name being repeated in her head. 	61
1	1	29	3	Judith, mine ears… Judith, mother of crones. 	45
1	1	29	4	These words sounded as if to implicate her as a worker of the forbidden arts.  	79
1	1	29	5	These were local actors and they borrowed from the names that were whispered around the small urban center of Hilmorton. 	121
1	1	29	6	Has Judith made a pact with the Devil? 	39
1	1	29	7	She could hear it now. 	23
1	1	29	8	Was it merely a coincidence for them to use her name in this small town?  	74
1	1	29	9	She was the most widely known Judith in this town who could work the “olde remedys”. 	85
1	1	29	10	She knew she had fair motives in her workings and that it was nearly always efficacious so that most people gave her heartfelt gratitude for her healing. 	154
1	1	29	11	Were the people starting to look for the scapegoats again? 	59
1	1	29	12	She shuddered at the thought and memories of women whose works were exaggerated from similar practices of physick and later tried and executed. 	144
1	1	29	13	I should not be so eager for such vanities as fame.	51
1	1	30	1	As people were rising from their seats, a noble looking gentleman in a white-laced ruff  collar, white stockings and the rest black velvets with gold embroidery including a wide-brimmed tall hat, curly long black hair, square black eyebrows and goatee, gentle eyes and rosy cheeks. 	282
1	1	30	2	His finger shh’d his lips as he passed a slip of paper to Judith and smiled at her husband then continued walking past with a retinue of two guards, three young ladies and a man dressed as a coach driver with a long feather in his hat. 	236
1	1	30	3	She opened the slip, her husband peering over her shoulder. 	60
1	1	30	4	It read:	8
1	1	31	1	It’s Mary. 	11
1	1	31	2	Mind her carefully! 	20
1	1	31	3	F.B.	4
1	1	32	1	As they stood re-reading the message in the coming darkness of twilight, the guide who would take the audience to their various homes came by with his torch, pulling people along behind him.  	192
1	1	32	2	The joined their children’s hands, Judith took her husband’s as John followed the torchbearer in the night with various gentry all around him. 	143
1	1	32	3	While Judith’s feet were not as dainty as they once were, she could at least be spared the sprained ankles on the tiny feet of the town’s spritely, young maidens. 	163
1	1	32	4	Those feet she could hear clacking over the stony walk most of the walk home. 	78
1	1	32	5	Some of these maidens had come out to theatre for their very first time and so she next wondered how many would be calling on her for a boneset plaster the next morning.  	171
1	1	32	6	Judith would glance back at Mary every so often wondering what it was Mary might have done to have gained the notice of the noble gentleman.	140
1	2	1	1	The Perkins home was one of several nestled in along Clifton Road. 	67
1	2	1	2	It stood out as a light colored brick and wood unit with two gables with smaller guest homes on either side surrounded by a well-battered-up and splintery picket fence patched by the wild brush and willows that found their way there.  	235
1	2	1	3	The bedrooms upstairs were warmed by the hearth and chimney. 	61
1	2	1	4	Mary’s black walnut hair framed blush cheeks and pale skin shivering over her small frame as she woke up.  	107
1	2	1	5	A thick quilt half covered her exposed arm out of her smock. 	61
1	2	1	6	She stretched her cold arms, shivered and snuck back into bed pulling the ragged covers, tattered into strips here and there taught over her head disappearing from view.	169
1	2	2	1	Everyone was out of bed except Mary and her two baby brothers lying in the spot between where mother and father slept on her right with Lizzie, Henry and Johnny’s spot on the left. 	181
1	2	2	2	Thomas, the older baby, was actually more of a toddler at three years of age and had shocks of curly hair that had started to lengthen and darken.  	148
1	2	2	3	Jacob, swaddled next to him was just a year old and had light shorter hair.  	77
1	2	2	4	He sucked his thumb off and on as his eyes fluttered through his dreams. 	73
1	2	2	5	Did they let her sleep in today? 	33
1	2	2	6	Mary looked at the empty books that lay on the table. 	54
1	2	2	7	One of them had her name on it. 	32
1	2	2	8	I will write a page every day. 	31
1	2	2	9	She could hear mother’s voice in her head reminding her to keep up with her school work. 	89
1	2	2	10	Mother was always pushing them to study and work hard in hopes they would obtain a greater position in society and life and while that intention seemed common, the intensity of her admonitions were peculiar compared to what they knew from visiting other children and their mothers.  	283
1	2	2	11	This giant bed’s stuffing was tied down with tautline hitches and batted up and repaired often.  	97
1	2	2	12	Small tables of odd sizes lined a wall.  	41
1	2	2	13	Some had books under them and everyone had a spot or a box of their own under them.  	85
1	2	2	14	Dried flowers and herbs hung from a hemp line tied between two posts for both protection and cooking.  	103
1	2	2	15	The casement open air windows were shuttered open allowing a gentle breeze through layers of drapes.  	102
1	2	2	16	Seats lined the windows for cooling off in the breeze and watching out over the yard for the possible visitor in the summer.	124
1	2	3	1	She reached down to grab her overclothes and took up the milk pail to get outside and milk the family’s cow so she could get Jacob his breakfast before mother would remind her. 	177
1	2	3	2	On her way out, she grabbed some bread, dabbed it in some honey and butter and took the rest with her on the way. 	114
1	2	3	3	Lizzie was sitting in the shade of the home on a bench, washing and teasing wool to be spun later. 	99
1	2	3	4	How does she work so hard? 	27
1	2	3	5	She had already so diligently finished scrubbing the clothes on the washboard and her hands were still fit carding wool from the ewes which were were lambing this past spring.  	177
1	2	3	6	She then overheard Henry pleading with John, “Please take me duck hunting!”	75
1	2	4	1	“Sorry Henry, you scared them all last time, I can’t take you if you want to eat game tonight.”	95
1	2	5	1	“I promise I won’t spook them. 	31
1	2	5	2	Please?”	8
1	2	6	1	Mother was tending the garden and father was overseeing the farm hands.	71
1	2	7	1	As Mary started to milk the cows she started to become entranced by the rhythm the milk made against the side of the pail. 	123
1	2	7	2	She felt a little pricking on her neck like a fly. 	51
1	2	7	3	She then felt a squirt to the face as Henry grabbed a nipple and squirted her down, the cow also taking alarm to the point Mary was afraid it might take it out on Henry but it didn’t. 	184
1	2	7	4	She squirted him back, he opened his mouth to catch it and laughed.	67
1	2	8	1	“Do that and ye won’t fill your pail!”	38
1	2	9	1	Mary was quiet this time, trying to focus through getting her milking chores done. 	83
1	2	9	2	She felt tired even though she was rested. 	43
1	2	9	3	She pulled a foxtail out of the neck of her smock realizing the pricking on her neck felt earlier was no fly. 	110
1	2	9	4	Henry apparently was bored not being able to go hunting but it was only a matter of time before he would be made to clean stables. 	131
1	2	9	5	Henry seemed to get away with it having Lizzie on his side. 	60
1	2	9	6	The fields were full of cowslips, orchids, poppies and cornflowers. 	68
1	2	9	7	The cow’s heavy grazing made the milk pails extra heavy as a result.	68
1	2	10	1	There was now plenty of butter to make. 	40
1	2	10	2	Mother was in the shade of the house by the hearthstone, working the dasher in the churn.	89
1	2	11	1	Mary could hear her mother’s soft chant, “Come butter come, come butter come, Peter stands at the gate, waiting for his buttered cake”	134
1	2	12	1	Mary was entranced further by the hand dropping the dasher with a twist making a steady rhythm to the kathunk-a-thunk-a-thunk of the churn. 	140
1	2	12	2	It was a comforting sound she had heard for as long as she could remember. 	75
1	2	12	3	Mary cradled the one-year old Jacob over her lap and steadily poured milk out of the cup for him. 	98
1	2	12	4	He’d swallow the milk to the same rhythm. 	42
1	2	12	5	She had become adept at this since Thomas was that age.  	57
1	2	12	6	She could now steady the cup while watching mother make butter out of the corner of her eye. 	93
1	2	12	7	Soon there would be sweet butter and buttermilk which would go into the cakes by evening. 	90
1	2	12	8	Henry soon burst in with some wildflowers he picked on his way back from the stable.	84
1	2	13	1	“These will be a fine batch Henry! 	35
1	2	13	2	I will have to save the marigolds and violets for my next batch of salve,” Judith exclaimed, her eyes brightening at the floral array.	134
1	2	14	1	Mary felt a scowl coming on at Henry’s interruption but before it could come out, Judith turned to Mary with “So would you like to go visit grandpa?” 	150
1	2	14	2	Mary’s heart leaped in delight. 	32
1	2	14	3	She would give anything to take a break from the hot afternoon with the cows again.	83
1	2	15	1	“Oh we must go!”	16
1	2	16	1	“Then let’s get out of these work rags and into our finery...but not until you help me finish the butter! 	106
1	2	16	2	Henry, go fetch me a firkin!”	29
1	2	17	1	Within a few minutes, Henry brought in a smaller dark peat colored firkin that looked like it had many fillings of butter. 	123
1	2	17	2	He gripped its lid attempting to free it from its vessel, but after a few puzzled looks, heaves and face-reddening tries, he let out a long sigh, He set it down on the table.	174
1	2	17	3	“This is impossible! 	21
1	2	17	4	It’s sealed too tight!”	23
1	2	18	1	Judith broke mid-churn to find a needle tipped wand from the table. 	68
1	2	18	2	Being a cunning woman in Hilmorton and more well known than even she knew, she often had curious and never-seen-before solutions to these odd little problems. 	159
1	2	18	3	She ordered Henry again, “Put it down in the center and come over here!”  	74
1	2	18	4	Henry did so as Judith held out her stick, just barely touching the firkin. 	76
1	2	18	5	She uttered some words under her breath. 	41
1	2	18	6	Names most likely.  	20
1	2	18	7	One of them sounded like Albertus. 	35
1	2	18	8	After a while she stopped muttering and everyone watched the firkin intently. 	78
1	2	18	9	Nothing.	8
1	2	19	1	A few seconds later, Mary let out a huge yawn from behind Judith’s arm and right into the base end of the wand she held.  	122
1	2	19	2	The sound of her ears popping resulted in an even greater pop coming right from the firkin and the lid hopped to the sound of its own accord. 	142
1	2	19	3	It appeared now to be loose. 	29
1	2	19	4	Henry grasped the lid, still staring in disbelief.  	52
1	2	19	5	He easily picked the lid right off. 	36
1	2	19	6	Judith smiled at Mary and Henry, who while still awestruck, went to hand the firkin to mother.  	96
1	2	19	7	She pulled them into hug and uttered a “Oh bless you Mary!” 	60
1	2	19	8	at her. 	8
1	2	19	9	Mary smiled to herself sheepishly feeling more important than she was used to and also remembering just how unique and unusual her mother was compared to most.	159
1	2	20	1	After the butter making business was all put away, Judith called everyone in the main parlour to wash and don their finest for grandpa.  	137
1	2	20	2	Michael Gater was a lonely and recent widower who had long been without children in his home. 	94
1	2	20	3	His daughter Judith and her family were among the few to ever visit him in his old age.	87
1	3	1	1	Their family strolled by foot during the day towards grandpa Gater’s house about a mile and a half away. 	105
1	3	1	2	Judith was carrying Jacob in her arms.  	40
1	3	1	3	As they neared his home, they stepped through the gate and into a wildflower spritzed greenery which was thick with fluff, bees and butterflies. 	145
1	3	1	4	A maypole towered off to the side, bedecked with bouquets of flowers and ribbons and spare cloth.	97
1	3	2	1	“Father! 	9
1	3	2	2	Grandpa!” 	10
1	3	2	3	they shouted together seeing an older man in clean black leather boots, grey stockings, dusty and billowing britches, a long white tunic showing through a waistcoat frayed at the shoulders. 	190
1	3	2	4	He had a somber face and flat jaw likely due to missing teeth and shocks of grey hair combed back haphazardly. 	111
1	3	2	5	He had walked out of the front door before they could even approach to knock.	77
1	3	3	1	“Judith, it’s been too long, your children are half grown!”	59
1	3	4	1	“Oh father, I was just here last week bringing you bread and butter.”	69
1	3	5	1	“And my good boy John, come in and pray tell me what you’ve grown this year,” he said to John Sr who still couldn’t get over how warm and fatherly he was to him.	161
1	3	6	1	“Just the ryegrass and barley this year.  	42
1	3	6	2	The wheat crop went too fast.”	30
1	3	7	1	As they all went inside, Judith set down the bread and butter Lizzie carried along the way and had just handed to her.  	120
1	3	7	2	John Sr. pulled all the chairs out of the corner and slid them across the floor noisily handing them to his children.  	119
1	3	7	3	Michael kept his rocking chair at the table.	44
1	3	8	1	“I brought you some sweet butter lacking the salt, just the way you like it Father.”	84
1	3	9	1	Michael lifted the warm bread out of the basket and cut off several slices for them. 	85
1	3	9	2	He liked to butter his bread and then turn it upside-down. 	59
1	3	9	3	John Sr. found this a little odd and it was a small joke he shared with the other sergeants in the past. 	105
1	3	9	4	Judith never found it quite as funny. 	38
1	3	9	5	Grandpa’s taste was fading and he found delight in savoring the butter directly on his tongue as he ate his bread.	114
1	3	10	1	After tea, he took them all out back to see his yard. 	54
1	3	10	2	Mary’s eyes beamed as if she saw a little wonderland back there.  	66
1	3	10	3	His home was well established and one time not so overgrown.	60
1	3	11	1	“You can go out and play but don’t wander off too far!”	55
1	3	12	1	John took Henry out to the woods chatting about their hunting plans. 	69
1	3	12	2	Judith took Thomas around by a finger trailing behind Mary and Lizzie who followed Michael around the garden.  	111
1	3	12	3	John Sr took over holding Jacob for a while.  	46
1	3	12	4	John Sr. had no qualms taking Jacob in his arms and resting in a chair outside as his wife and kids went out for the latest tour of the garden. 	144
1	3	12	5	Michael’s home was bigger than his and full of old furnishings, silver and copper bowls, plates, earthwares and contraptions he had made.  	139
1	3	12	6	If he weren’t so proud, he might have preferred to raise his children there.	76
1	3	13	1	Mary gasped looking around Michael’s herbs and flower garden.  	63
1	3	13	2	There were lilac bushes, galbanum, brown-eyed susans, zinnias, foxgloves, bluebells, bachelor’s buttons, columbines and honeysuckles among many other varieties.  	162
1	3	13	3	Some nightshade vines crawled around the corners with some morning glories.	75
1	3	14	1	Judith caught up with her youngest daughter, “Mary, wait up for mother.”	72
1	3	15	1	“Yes mother?”	13
1	3	16	1	“Would you like to stay here and help grandpa?”	47
1	3	17	1	“I would most enjoy it mother. 	31
1	3	17	2	Thank you.”	11
1	3	18	1	Michael broke in, his poor hearing making for interruption, “Mary, you’ve grown into such a fine young lady.  	110
1	3	18	2	Would you help me pick some of the flower tops on those over there?”	68
1	3	19	1	Mary went for the foxgloves, some wolfsbane, comfrey and lavender flowers in their myriad purple blossoms.	106
1	3	20	1	“That lavender I can use for a salve that can heal scrapes,” said Michael, starting to play the instructor as Judith watched smiling.	133
1	3	21	1	Judith called after John and Henry and took Jacob back from her husband and giving Thomas back to him to handhold.  	116
1	3	21	2	Elizabeth followed behind her. 	31
1	3	21	3	As they were gathering and picking up coats, baskets and bags, Judith called to Michael and Mary, “We shall be back again in a few mornings.”	141
1	3	22	1	Michael took Mary’s bushels of flowers and set them out on a big cluttered table full of picks, brushes, bars, and tools she had never seen before.	147
1	3	23	1	“I think it’s about time I show you how to make the salve with something we call enfleurage.  	94
1	3	23	2	First you must flatten the butter and I like to melt it in the sun and then take it into the cool room.  	105
1	3	23	3	While it’s still melted, put all the flower petals in the butter.” 	67
1	3	23	4	Michael poured it over a board.  	33
1	3	23	5	“Now we’ll roll it around into a ball and knead it,” he said as he dipped his hands into the greasy puddle.	107
1	3	24	1	“Won’t I get the flowers greasy?” 	34
1	3	24	2	asked Mary, shrinking away from the mess on the table.	54
1	3	25	1	“Wet your hands in the water first and it won’t be so bad. 	59
1	3	25	2	That’s the way. 	16
1	3	25	3	Now let’s melt it again in the sun and drain it through the cloth and into the second dish. 	92
1	3	25	4	Pick some more flowers for me will you?”	40
1	3	26	1	“Yes Grandfather.”	18
1	3	27	1	“Now we need to do this again a few times and we’ll soon have a wonderful and fragrant salve.”	94
1	3	28	1	Over the course of the rest of the day and the next, Michael showed her how to make a violet flavored honey for coughs, a yarrow and mugwort tincture for toothaches, and fits and a comfrey and mint tea for broken bones. 	220
1	3	28	2	He smiled brightly. 	20
1	3	28	3	For a moment his face seemed about as young as her older brother, Henry’s face, despite being sixty years in age. 	114
1	3	28	4	He must have used a lot of the salve to keep his youthful appearance she surmised. 	83
1	3	28	5	Grandpa had a tall soft bed in a loft for Mary to sleep in.  	61
1	3	28	6	It was a dark scratched and stained wooden bed frame showing age which must have cost a fortune once upon a time.  	115
1	3	28	7	The whitewashed plaster on the wall had uneven textures and was cracking away.  	80
1	3	28	8	The bed had ropes which were tightened to hold up mattresses which she guess were filled with herbs like hops, mums, daisies and lilacs amongst the discarded grain grasses. 	173
1	3	28	9	In a corner was an uneven wooden dresser with a chipped water basin on top with a mismatched pitcher.	101
1	3	29	1	On the third day, Mary wondered when she’d see mother and father again.  	73
1	3	29	2	She woke up to help grandpa with breakfast and gather eggs.  	61
1	3	29	3	After that, they went out together to a plot of  tomatoes.  	60
1	3	29	4	Mary had never seen them on any of the other farms she had been to.	67
1	3	30	1	“Most folks think these fruits are poisonous, but I have eaten them every summer.  	83
1	3	30	2	They flower like a nightshade but have a yellow blossom and they taste nothing like it.  	89
1	3	30	3	The places I’ve travelled to, I got some seeds from and these kind are not poison and I do believe they are good for the belly and the heart.”  	144
1	3	30	4	He sliced one in half and showed it to her. 	44
1	3	30	5	“See?  	7
1	3	30	6	It looks like the heart and if your heart beats too fast and too weak, then a tomato will fix it right.” 	105
1	3	30	7	With that he pulled out a small brush.  	40
1	3	30	8	Mary liked to just listen to him speak and would be simple in her reply to him.  	81
1	3	30	9	He brushed the yellow tomato blossoms pushing their pollen around in strokes gently around the flower. 	103
1	3	30	10	“There, now you try it.”	24
1	3	31	1	Mary took the brush and did as he did.  	40
1	3	31	2	He had her hand pollinate to get more fruit from the tomatoes.  	64
1	3	31	3	He said something about the bees being few this year.  	55
1	3	31	4	After this, he went to show her a big barrel and when he took the lid off, there was a mild stench.  	101
1	3	31	5	“This is a water to make plants grow,  I just toss all my scraps into this.”  	78
1	3	31	6	Mary noticed maggots swimming and flies congregating around it.  	65
1	3	31	7	“They’re pesky but they only add to the mix.” 	46
1	3	31	8	He took a pot with a handle into the barrel and walked it out to the tomatoes and poured it over the main stems to water the roots below.	137
1	3	32	1	Next, he took her to a beehive and had her stand back as he draped himself and made a smoker out of an old kettle. 	115
1	3	32	2	He showed her the combs of honey and sliced off a plate of it which they shared inside. 	88
1	3	32	3	“When I can’t eat all the honey, I put some of it in my still here.” 	69
1	3	32	4	He lifted the top off a seal and out came a yeasty sweet gas.  	63
1	3	32	5	He poured some out and resealed it again. 	42
1	3	32	6	“I can show you how to make this into a tincture medicine for aches and pains.	78
1	3	33	1	Mary wondered at how easy an existence Michael seemed to have.  	64
1	3	33	2	He was old but had almost everything he needed out of his garden.  	67
1	3	33	3	She knew he would sometimes go to the markets with them but he had gone out less and less over the years and they went to him more and more.  	142
1	3	33	4	As they were walking out to the garden again, Mary stopped him at the strawberry patch where last year Mary had transplanted strawberry vines. 	143
1	3	33	5	The strawberries were looking weak and blackened in the leaves.	63
1	3	34	1	“Why aren’t my strawberries growing?” 	38
1	3	34	2	she inquired.	13
1	3	35	1	“Strawberries like well-drained soil.  	39
1	3	35	2	The water has to drain from them or else they bog.”	51
1	3	36	1	“What’s bog?”	13
1	3	37	1	“Oh, that’s where the stems can’t breathe and rot grows on them and they get slimes like a pond.”	97
1	3	38	1	“Ohh, ok.”	10
1	3	39	1	“I’ll get some sand. 	21
1	3	39	2	This soil would be better for watercress and nasturtiums.”	58
1	3	40	1	Michael got some sand he had bagged up.  	41
1	3	40	2	It was too heavy for him so she found a small cart and wheeled it for him.  	76
1	3	40	3	“My you are helpful.”  	23
1	3	40	4	This made Mary smile happily that she was being as helpful as she hoped she would be.  	87
1	3	40	5	Right as Mary was adding sand to a dry spot in the soil, she saw her mother walking up the road.  	98
1	3	40	6	Judith was pleased with Mary’s work and Michael gave her a good report. 	72
1	3	40	7	Michael sent her home with some of her creations they made together in little pots. 	84
1	3	40	8	As she left he shouted to her, “Come back soon, I have some old receipts that works really good for the colic in babes and a mead I think you’d really like.” 	158
1	3	40	9	He shouted so hard he erupted into a stream of non-stop coughing fits.  	72
1	3	40	10	Judith noticed how he was always bundling up and complaining of stiffness and cold.	83
1	4	1	1	As Judith and Mary entered their kitchen back home, Mary could see Lizzie was busy washing pots.  	98
1	4	1	2	Mary excitedly rushed out words just barely comprehensible, “Lizzie, I had such a wonderful time, I learned so much, I have to tell you about the flower butter I made!”	168
1	4	2	1	Lizzie gave her a stern look and threw a rag at her. 	53
1	4	2	2	“Want to know what I did all week?” 	36
1	4	2	3	she said pointing to a pile of pots.	36
1	4	3	1	Mary stared at the pot that Lizzie pointed at and one fells down and broke into pieces. 	88
1	4	3	2	Henry came in looking a little shocked but also like it wasn’t too surprising. 	79
1	4	3	3	Lizzie ignored it as if to assume Mary might have brushed it and knocked it over, already somewhat blinded by her anger. 	121
1	4	3	4	Lizzie stomped her feet. 	25
1	4	3	5	“Ooooh! 	8
1	4	3	6	You clumsy fool!” 	18
1	4	3	7	and with that she threw down a broom and stomped off. 	54
1	4	3	8	Mary began to sob and walked slowly to the broom and started to sweep. 	71
1	4	3	9	Henry approached Mary and put his arm around her.	49
1	4	4	1	“It’s not your fault, she’s been like this all week.”	53
1	4	5	1	Mary stopped sobbing but was still flushed in the face and was aching in the pit of her stomach. 	97
1	4	5	2	As she looked up at Henry, she looked about ready to break into sobs again.	75
1	4	6	1	“Please don’t Mary… Lizzie drops things herself sometimes. 	59
1	4	6	2	Little accidents make life interesting. 	40
1	4	6	3	Who knows, maybe it is our Lord’s greater purpose to keep us well by not having us eat from old dishes...maybe. 	112
1	4	6	4	Or maybe it would have later fell on my toe!  	46
1	4	6	5	So thank you Mary, thank you for saving my big toe!”  	54
1	4	6	6	Mary continued to sob but Henry continued, “Mary, I got to go to grandpa’s last year too. 	90
1	4	6	7	Did he show you how to make the anise and mint liqueur or the dandelion wine?”	78
1	4	7	1	“Not yet”	9
1	4	8	1	“What did he teach you?”	24
1	4	9	1	Mary took a few moments to compose  herself and sniffled a few times before she got the words out. 	99
1	4	9	2	“We didn’t work that much.”	27
1	4	10	1	“Come on Mary, please tell me.”	31
1	4	11	1	“Ok, well…”	11
1	4	12	1	“Well?”	7
1	4	13	1	“Well, we made a violet flavored cough honey. 	46
1	4	13	2	It’s sweet, like a candy. 	26
1	4	13	3	I sneaked a little taste and it was the sweetest thing I have ever tasted. 	75
1	4	13	4	It tasted like flower nectar.”	30
1	4	14	1	“Oh, now he didn’t show me that. 	33
1	4	14	2	He didn’t let me drink any of it the stuff we made...said it had to be for pains and ailments or for when I got older and wanted a good tonic.”	143
1	4	15	1	For a moment, Mary was still looking down.  	44
1	4	15	2	Henry put his arm around her consoling her. 	44
1	4	15	3	Mary felt touched and turned to him, and embraced him, taking him by surprise, “Thank you Henry.”	97
1	4	16	1	Henry looked confused but then put his hand on her shoulder to gently break her embrace and told her, “Any time you want someone to talk to, I’m here for you. 	159
1	4	16	2	You mustn’t forget it!”	23
1	4	17	1	Mary thought a little better of Henry from that time forward. 	62
1	4	17	2	Usually it would have been Lizzie who would do this for Mary whenever Henry teased her.  	89
1	4	17	3	Lizzie ignored her and refused to talk to her for an entire week and instead produced a fair amount of wool which she then took to the tuckers every week. 	155
1	4	17	4	She was soon bringing home felts and some extra coins which pleased Judith but not entirely.	92
1	4	18	1	“Lizzie, you need to talk to your sister.  	43
1	4	18	2	She will become forever melancholy unless you make amends with her.  	69
1	4	18	3	Remember that the Good Lord says to forgive.”	45
1	4	19	1	“I don’t remember the last time I got to stay with Grandpa and I don’t remember it being so long.  	99
1	4	19	2	Why does Mary get to go there?”	31
1	4	20	1	“Don’t be jealous, Mary’s craft is a different one than yours.  	64
1	4	20	2	You are making good money from yours already.  	47
1	4	20	3	Mary needs to learn something…” Judith almost said “in case either one of you doesn’t marry” but thought the better not to.  	125
1	4	20	4	This was a fear all too real as she had seen so many of her spinster neighbors end up in the poorhouse. 	104
1	4	20	5	“Grandpa’s cough has me worried. 	33
1	4	20	6	It goes on and on like he might not clear it up. 	49
1	4	20	7	I want you to make him a warm coat.”	36
1	4	21	1	“Yes mother.”, she replied with raised brow. 	45
1	4	21	2	Lizzie was ecstatic with the idea of making a piece of clothing again. 	71
1	4	21	3	It was a job that mother usually got to do.	43
1	4	22	1	Judith watched Lizzie spinning the yarn, “Why don’t you sing a good little psalm to enchant the thread as I instructed you?”	124
1	4	23	1	Lizzie grumbled at the request. 	32
1	4	23	2	She thumbed through the dusty copy of the Great Bible randomly and found Psalm 88. 	83
1	4	23	3	Her voice see-sawed through the words in cadences, just passable enough to be counted song.	91
1	4	24	1	When she finished, Judith took the coat and folded it into a sack to surprise him with.  	89
1	4	24	2	She walked to Grandpa’s home with Lizzie in tow.  	50
1	4	24	3	She knocked on the door but there was no answer.  	50
1	4	24	4	After a patient wait and a looking at the birds in the sky, Judith grew worried and entered to find Michael laying on the floor gasping for air and blue in the face. 	166
1	4	24	5	She seated him in his favorite backed chair and Lizzie took out the coat and put it over him.  	95
1	4	24	6	He smiled weakly and mostly through his eyes.  	47
1	4	24	7	Their worries took them through the rest of the day and into the night. 	72
1	4	24	8	Judith stayed by him all the night watching over him and making sure he was kept warm. 	87
1	4	24	9	She tried to feed him but he simply brushed it feebly aside.  	62
1	4	24	10	The thought seemed to give him even louder coughing fits. 	58
1	4	24	11	Just past sunset and into dusk, grandpa stopped breathing altogether and slumped to the side in his chair.  	108
1	4	24	12	Lizzie noticed it first, her tears trickling and dripping to the floor.  	73
1	4	24	13	Judith hugged her father and wept over him, caressing his face and then kneeling and wailing on the floor.  	108
1	4	24	14	Lizzie brought Judith a blanket and let her cry herself to sleep on the floor.  	80
1	4	24	15	Lizzie thought long and hard about what she’d have to tell Mary.  	66
1	4	24	16	She was just barely able to contain the tears herself and felt guilty that she couldn’t feel the same as her mother.	116
1	4	25	1	The next morning, a tangerine colored sun rose dimly from the horizon and up behind a pink and purple paint-washed sky tinting the Perkin’s family yard with its dew weeping wild grasses. 	187
1	4	25	2	Judith returned grief stricken with the sad news. 	50
1	4	25	3	Mary took her own turn crying in her mother’s arms. 	52
1	4	25	4	Lizzie looked on and while she couldn’t cry, she felt miserable. 	65
1	4	25	5	She felt guilt for her lack of timing in making the coat, for her treatment of Mary, for not being able to mourn as much, for having made something so precious for him in vain. 	177
1	4	25	6	Her sadness sunk slow and lasted longer.  	42
1	4	25	7	Judith took the long white apron from the front of her skirt and wiped Mary’s tears and patted her cheeks dry. 	111
1	4	25	8	All the children came in and cried at the news and John Sr unexpectedly broke into sobs and red eyes as well. 	110
1	4	25	9	John Sr. composed himself and went out with the boys to go out to his home and bury his father-in-law.	102
1	4	26	1	Outside Michael’s home on the east side of the house stood several of the Gater family grave  markers. 	103
1	4	26	2	The Gater family  liked to keep their ancestors close. 	55
1	4	26	3	Mary remembered as he was being buried how Michael was going to show her even more wonderful things. 	101
1	4	26	4	His home was like a visit to the fairy worlds and nothing could compare with that experience. 	94
1	4	26	5	Now he was gone. 	17
1	4	26	6	Judith was now at a loss as to how to proceed with Mary’s training and given the gravity of Mary’s need to learn, one of her greatest opportunities was now being buried deep within the earth. 	192
1	4	26	7	He was not only a teacher but a constant supply of optimism and only now she realized, it was for them and not himself. 	120
1	4	26	8	His pains he kept secret all the while healing others of their maladies, he could do nothing for himself. 	106
1	4	26	9	Perhaps he knew it was futile and that the best thing he could do was to show one last bit of strength.	103
1	5	1	1	Next day, a shadow of mourning fell over the Perkins home. 	59
1	5	1	2	Passing clouds dimmed and lit the bare floors through their windows. 	69
1	5	1	3	John Sr and Jr. did most of the work as Judith and the girls were allowed time to let all their tears out and their  memories in.  	131
1	5	1	4	Judith spent hours by candlelight writing everything she could remember into her book. 	87
1	5	1	5	She made Mary do the same. 	27
1	5	1	6	Judith slowly regained the need to do her chores and so she started to make butter again the next day but the despairing tone her butter chant slowed her. 	155
1	5	1	7	She’d look over at Mary and they both held a tear in their eye as they woefully exchanged sympathetic glances.	110
1	5	2	1	As dusk soon arrived, Judith pulled herself up and put on her cloak. 	69
1	5	2	2	She whispered something to Lizzie who nodded secretively in response and then turned to her second oldest daughter, “Mary, it is time I take you to our kin’s land.”	164
1	5	3	1	With that, she took out Mary’s cloak and they both strolled through rolling grass mounds on their adventure. 	109
1	5	3	2	Lizzie stayed behind to tend the two baby boys.	47
1	5	4	1	Outside the door Judith told her “Lizzie’s been out earlier today laying flowers on all the graves, and praying to the good Lord if he would send them to find papa.”.  	168
1	5	4	2	She walked up to rain weathered mossy gravestones and pointed at one, “This is where mama is buried.“ Isabel Baylie was written on the tombstone.	145
1	5	5	1	A gale of wind came through and rocked the tree branches making a few twig snaps and creak like the beams in a stony church. 	125
1	5	5	2	The dusk was now at its dimmest and the night fell within the hour. 	68
1	5	5	3	A green orb gently grew, floating above the other headstones and trees, a will-o-the-wisp. 	91
1	5	5	4	Judith seemed to take it as a sign. 	36
1	5	5	5	To Mary, these were common to the marshlands and while she may have seen one from a distance before, she never saw one close. 	126
1	5	5	6	Judith broke out with verse:	28
1	5	6	1	The Master is here.	19
1	5	7	1	And long would I tarry	22
1	5	8	1	But I open my cove	18
1	5	9	1	By St. 	7
1	5	9	2	Peter and Mary	14
1	5	10	1	A tap on the tree with a stick produced a very curious motion. 	63
1	5	10	2	Immediately, the vines parted over what now appeared to be a natural tree hollow archway that led into a cellar built into the cool north face of the hill.	155
1	5	11	1	“Follow me.”	12
1	5	12	1	Inside this cellar was a wall of masonry. 	42
1	5	12	2	It was like a small mausoleum and a laboratory where a single casket lay in front of a wall with a recessed shelf stuffed with bottles on one side and skulls on another. 	170
1	5	12	3	Mary held onto dear breath as she beheld it’s marvel.  	55
1	5	12	4	Judith gently took Mary by the arm to a chair and table in the middle of the room.	82
1	5	13	1	“Today, I will share with you what my mother shared with me. 	61
1	5	13	2	You will carry forward the wisdom of the wives, continue our tales and our trade I do not ask an oath but as we are surrounded here by our mothers, what we say here will be binding. 	182
1	5	13	3	Are you willing to stay?	24
1	5	13	4	“	1
1	5	14	1	“Yes mother.”	13
1	5	15	1	“I reveal to you now that I am both your mother and your Queen. 	64
1	5	15	2	A child’s loyalty is naturally to their mother first. 	54
1	5	15	3	This has not changed but has only become more sure. 	52
1	5	15	4	Your blood is precious and royal. 	34
1	5	15	5	You are an heir princess. 	26
1	5	15	6	Please ask me anything you wish freely here	43
1	5	15	7	.	1
1	5	15	8	“	1
1	5	16	1	“So if I am a princess, who will be my subjects?”	49
1	5	17	1	”We are not the Queens of this land. 	37
1	5	17	2	No, we are the Queens of something greater, a hidden kingdom that is as invisible as air and thought. 	102
1	5	17	3	The Realm of Wisdom, the crowning jewel of all mental powers. 	62
1	5	17	4	Many girls are gifted but you will be their ruler. 	51
1	5	17	5	If you cannot rule in force, then you will rule in influence and suggestion. 	77
1	5	17	6	Essentially, you will rule others without them knowing they are being ruled.”	77
1	5	18	1	“Who can I tell?”	17
1	5	19	1	“No one. 	9
1	5	19	2	Never. 	7
1	5	19	3	We rule for power in ideas over glory. 	39
1	5	19	4	You will write books and your readers will be your court.  	59
1	5	19	5	You may pass this secret on to your daughter, any fair-not-handsome son you have, and as a last resort, your most kindred in spirit who has manifested a gift.. 	160
1	5	19	6	I will give to you learning and tests in the arts of healing, charm, reading and writing, consultation with the spirits, both your ancestors and the dead of others. 	165
1	5	19	7	You will work miracle...some that are understood and others that are not. 	74
1	5	19	8	Some will call you a demon and some will call you an angel. 	60
1	5	19	9	Some will call you a witch and others will call you a Goodwife. 	64
1	5	19	10	Do not boast of yourself and call yourself anything. 	53
1	5	19	11	Let your virtues be your only title.”	37
1	5	20	1	Judith lit a fire in a fireplace in the dark with what seemed to be a mere snap of the fingers. 	96
1	5	20	2	Did she know some formula for fire or was she so powerful that she could summon it upon request?  	98
1	5	20	3	The cold slowly faded into warmth and light.	44
1	5	21	1	”You can have great influence even without fame. 	49
1	5	21	2	Protect your name and your power with the strongest of shields and that is secrecy. 	84
1	5	21	3	To have power is to be free. 	29
1	5	21	4	To be free, you cannot be in debt of mind to dogmas. 	53
1	5	21	5	You cannot be in debit to the gaoler by doing someone harm. 	60
1	5	21	6	You shall not act against their will and in so doing cause a rebellion against you. 	84
1	5	21	7	You will not contest their idea of their deity. 	48
1	5	21	8	It is futile. 	14
1	5	21	9	Do no harm to yourself. 	24
1	5	21	10	Do all you can to survive and continue. 	40
1	5	21	11	Subject yourself to no one other than your mother and your conscience, and do not borrow unless not doing so would cause you to commit act against the former. 	159
1	5	21	12	You may worship what you may and be loyal to your own dearest spirit or deity but to not enslave yourself to church or kingdom except it be to respect the wishes of those who do not contest your own or to avoid being discovered. 	229
1	5	21	13	You may follow their just intentions. 	38
1	5	21	14	You can appear to be theirs. 	29
1	5	21	15	You can serve your fellows but only after you serve your future generation. 	76
1	5	21	16	While you don’t have to subject yourself to them, it is your duty to serve and influence and in so doing have power and magic on your side. 	140
1	5	21	17	Set out ideas, whisper and listen wherever you go.” 	52
1	5	21	18	Judith paused to breathe, “First, I give you your magic wand. 	62
1	5	21	19	You can create anything you want with this.”	44
1	5	22	1	“How can I do that?”	20
1	5	23	1	“Just believe me, it will come to you. 	39
1	5	23	2	Your first test of magic is to summon a bird. 	46
1	5	23	3	The best bird you can.”  	25
1	5	23	4	Judith handed Mary a carpenter’s pencil. 	41
1	5	23	5	Mary suddenly realized what was expected. 	42
1	5	23	6	She had watched mother draw before. 	36
1	5	23	7	Mary took the pencil and sketched a bird. 	42
1	5	23	8	Judith lit a candle and left her there to draw. 	48
1	5	23	9	Mary finished sketching but then noticed her mother had left. 	62
1	5	23	10	For a moment, Mary thought her mother might have just vanished or flew up the chimney given what she just saw. 	111
1	5	23	11	Mary started to get scared but she waited patiently. 	53
1	5	23	12	Mary couldn’t tell if it was day or night after a while. 	57
1	5	23	13	Mary had drawn a blue jay. 	27
1	5	23	14	In the passing hours, Mary took time to perfect her drawing in little details. 	79
1	5	23	15	After she finished drawing, she slept at the table. 	52
1	5	23	16	When she awoke, Judith had returned.	36
1	5	24	1	“This looks very nice. 	23
1	5	24	2	I am not judging you solely on talent. 	39
1	5	24	3	You can tell a lot about a person by how they draw a simple image of a bird. 	77
1	5	24	4	This is beautiful Mary. 	24
1	5	24	5	You’ve surpassed my expectations and I can see now where you have potential ability and I will help you master it. 	115
1	5	24	6	I give you the name Corinna. 	29
1	5	24	7	It means you are a Raven and a Queen raven is to a king like a dragon is to a catfish. 	87
1	5	24	8	You can do what your heart speaks with this gift and you can fly into the night.”	81
1	5	25	1	Judith put her hand on the door and held it there as she cautioned Mary, “Tell no one of this place, use it only when you need to escape but let none follow you here. 	167
1	5	25	2	In that case, lead them to their own danger. 	45
1	5	25	3	If anything befalls this place, it is up to you to make another like it and at least as hidden if you can manage it.”	117
1	5	26	1	Mary smiled. 	13
1	5	26	2	She heard some birds chirping at that point and looked about and saw that early dawn light was starting to break through where they had entered late at dusk. 	158
1	5	26	3	As Mary emerged, the world seemed to take on a new rose tinted hue.	67
1	5	27	1	Being that it was the height of summer, the Perkin family’s modest home took on a tiring, muggy hot air. 	105
1	5	27	2	The Perkins children were starting to feel the dull agitations of cabin fever. 	79
1	5	27	3	In Hilmorton, there were a few taverns where Sergeant John Perkins regularly went. 	83
1	5	27	4	He handed Judith a purse and said, “Take the children out to one of the ordinaries on the main road and let them eat whatever they want.”	137
1	5	28	1	Judith realized she’d need to pack for her babies there, at least changing cloth enough for a day. 	99
1	5	28	2	There were occasionally women working as wet nurses at the ordinaries. 	71
1	5	28	3	There was no shortage of mothers who had lost children this year. 	66
1	5	28	4	She remembered there would always a lot of activity there, there would be butter, wool, herbs and medicines she’d pack for the trading post. 	141
1	5	28	5	Her husband often guarded the ordinaries to ensure there was no troubles from drunkenness or theft there. 	106
1	5	28	6	The family often went there together and settled by other ladies and their husbands to avoid the obnoxiously loud crowds in the bar area where all the courting and drinking occurred.	182
1	6	1	1	The entire Perkins entourage arrived at the Hilmorton ordinaries. 	66
1	6	1	2	The ordinaries were a bustling combination store, tavern, trading post and entertainment center. 	97
1	6	1	3	Bird cages lined the arched hallways. 	38
1	6	1	4	The gentry were coddling their poodles as marketeers tried to upstage the tide of barking that followed each passerby. 	119
1	6	1	5	After unloading their goods and hauling them over the main porch, they made rounds to say hellos and sell the items they could sell to the merchant there. 	155
1	6	1	6	Judith took Thomas and Jacob with her to chat with a mother who had just had her first child. 	94
1	6	1	7	Johnny, seeing some of his friends left to chat with them and left the money bag with Henry. 	93
1	6	1	8	Lizzie, Henry and Mary found a corner table all to themselves. 	63
1	6	1	9	Henry ordered a plate of stew and a pot of ale for all to share. 	65
1	6	1	10	Lizzie and Mary  were quiet and Henry glanced at Lizzie.	56
1	6	2	1	“Mary, I’m sorry I was cross with you,” spoke Lizzie.	53
1	6	3	1	“I am sorry…” started Mary	26
1	6	4	1	“No, don’t apologize, I searched my heart and found the sin of covetousness towards you. 	89
1	6	4	2	I should be more stalwart as your older sister to check my heart when it comes to what you receive. 	100
1	6	4	3	I usually receive those things first before you. 	49
1	6	4	4	I was not wise to forget that. 	31
1	6	4	5	My melancholy and pains have been working on me. 	49
1	6	4	6	Forgive me?”	12
1	6	5	1	Henry smiled and nodded at Mary.	32
1	6	6	1	“Yes, of course. 	17
1	6	6	2	You’re my older sister and I do all in my power to be true to you and share all I have with you.”  	99
1	6	6	3	Mary thought back to her night in the cave. 	44
1	6	6	4	She didn’t know if Lizzie knew all that or not. 	48
1	6	6	5	She had not had any instruction on what they could discuss with each other as a family.	87
1	6	7	1	“I think I know how you’re feeling Mary. 	41
1	6	7	2	I know you want to say something but do not let it worry you.”	62
1	6	8	1	“Lizzie, can we speak of such things here?”	43
1	6	9	1	“Oh, I was not going to say much more. 	39
1	6	9	2	Don’t fret.”	12
1	6	10	1	“Dinner is served!” 	20
1	6	10	2	announced the barkeeper with long grey hair and a wispy beard. 	63
1	6	10	3	With that, a large plate steaming with hot brown gravies, smelling like a Christmas roast came out. 	100
1	6	10	4	Cooked beets, rutabagas and carrots glistened among the chunks of meat.  	73
1	6	10	5	He handed each of them a plate.	31
1	6	11	1	Mary’s eyes were much bigger than her stomach and she passed her stew to Henry. 	80
1	6	11	2	Lizzie ate all of hers.	23
1	6	12	1	“Henry, where do you hide all that stew?”	41
1	6	13	1	Henry jokingly shot an angry scowl but then grinned, his mouth too full to answer.  	84
1	6	13	2	His plate was soon clear followed by Lizzie’s. 	47
1	6	13	3	Just before they left, they noticed some footmen storm into the dining area. 	77
1	6	13	4	Mary overheard their conversation.	34
1	6	14	1	“I’ll be hanging in chains if I don’t find it immediately!”	59
1	6	15	1	“I swore it was right here!”	28
1	6	16	1	“Some pick pocket’s unlucky day just arrived.”	46
1	6	17	1	Henry was lazily leaving the table and did not notice Mary grabbing the Perkin’s coin pouch and leaving with Lizzie to meet mother. 	132
1	6	17	2	On the bench where Mary sat had been a second coin pouch and it looked a bit similar to the one Sergeant Perkins, their father owned.  	135
1	6	17	3	As Henry lagged behind and thought Mary had left the family’s money behind, he picked up the strange coin pouch and carried it off.  	133
1	6	17	4	As he was catching up to Mary and Lizzie, one of the soldiers pointed to Henry’s pouch shouting in a thick rural Worcestershire accent. 	136
1	6	17	5	“I caught him the little cutpurse!” 	36
1	6	17	6	as he grabbed Henry by the collar.	34
1	6	18	1	Mary looked around hearing his voice in the distance and not finding Henry grew concerned, but the soldiers were blocking her view and she started to panic and wonder if he was part of that.	190
1	6	19	1	Henry was confused with this soldier’s aggression and thought low of his class thinking he might be a thief.  	110
1	6	19	2	He wasn’t aware that the coin pouch he was carrying was not his own but theirs left behind by accident.  	105
1	6	19	3	He therefore defended his claim to what he thought was his family’s money in his hand.  	88
1	6	19	4	It was hard earned and unforgivable to lose. 	45
1	6	19	5	He was not used to this kind of treatment given his father’s social status as well as his similar position in rank.	115
1	6	20	1	“That’s ours!”	14
1	6	20	2	, Henry protested but the brash sounding footman overpowered him and grabbed the pouch pulling on it as shrunk back.	116
1	6	21	1	The footman glared at him with a rotting smile on his coarse unshaven and grease smudged face and swung the coin bag against the boy’s head. 	141
1	6	21	2	“Ye don’t want to let go do ye?”	32
1	6	22	1	Mary finally made her way through the room in view of Henry and was there watching just as this footman swung his bag at him after yanking it back.  	149
1	6	22	2	The coins clashed and clinked against Henry’s head.   	54
1	6	22	3	Henry’s voice let out a loud “oomph” and struggled to swallow and breathe.  	76
1	6	22	4	He looked blue and struggled with a few more breaths and fell on the floor rolling. 	84
1	6	22	5	One of the soldiers yelled at him, “Why did you do that?” 	58
1	6	22	6	And they started arguing.	25
1	6	23	1	Mary and Lizzie yelled, “Mother! 	33
1	6	23	2	Get in here!”	13
1	6	24	1	Both let out screams of terror as they saw him rolling around on the floor rhythmically convulsing and vomiting. 	113
1	6	24	2	Judith came in the room, looked towards Henry and let out a high pitched scream and for a moment, the room seemed to shudder. 	126
1	6	24	3	She dashed between the footmen and her traumatized son, and gave the attacking footman a look that made him turn pale, freezing stiff. 	135
1	6	24	4	He fell back onto a few steps and braced a wall and started gasping for air himself. 	85
1	6	24	5	His companions stepped back watching her suspiciously. 	55
1	6	24	6	Judith knelt down holding helplessly to him  and comforting him, clearing everything around him. 	97
1	6	24	7	Everyone backed away and several townsfolk ran to get help. 	60
1	6	24	8	Henry continued flailing weakly for minutes under his mother’s red, wet wailing face and finally collapsed; completely drained of his last fight for life. 	155
1	6	24	9	She tried to shock him back to life with hand gestures on his body and waved her hands over him. 	97
1	6	24	10	Judith stubbornly continued to no avail. 	41
1	6	24	11	She was not used to being so helpless. 	39
1	6	24	12	She had often been the one to rescue others when they fell but with her own son this day, she felt utterly helpless and useless to him although her sense of disappointment in herself was completely overwhelmed by the apparent loss of her son. 	243
1	6	24	13	Her eyes and mind could not agree and she refused to believe he could no longer be helped despite being usually able to know full well she couldn’t possibly help him any longer.  	179
1	6	24	14	A mother’s son can never be given up on. 	41
1	6	24	15	Mary and Lizzie came up at this time looking on in terror, starting to realize their mother’s complete mental breakdown. 	121
1	6	24	16	“Come back Henry!” 	19
1	6	24	17	“Come back!” 	13
1	6	24	18	“Come back!”...	15
1	6	24	19	Judith repeated over, soon joined by Lizzie, Mary and Johnny. 	62
1	6	24	20	Judith’s friend had been tending her youngest seeing her in need and unable to ask for help, she naturally stepped in without a second thought.. 	145
1	6	24	21	Johnny went to look for his father. 	36
1	6	24	22	However, another well-dressed sergeant and a captain with even shinier boots, clean vestments and black leather scabbard strode in. 	132
1	6	24	23	“What did you do!?” 	20
1	6	24	24	he shouted at the footman.	26
1	6	25	1	“Tha’ thief took our coins and refused to give ‘ar back so I took it fro’ him.”	79
1	6	26	1	“What did you to the boy?!” 	28
1	6	26	2	the captain demanded looking him dead in the eye.	49
1	6	27	1	Judith looked at him and he started stammering. 	48
1	6	27	2	The sergeant whispered to his captain, “That’s his mother.”	59
1	6	28	1	“Tha’ knave was the thief who took our bill collecting,” he plead with his explanation.	87
1	6	29	1	Judith clenched her teeth and got a word out finally, “He is no thief.” as she looked through each of them as she held Henry in her arms, not letting him go.	157
1	6	30	1	Another of the footman’s party spoke,“We had that coin purse when we sat down but I don’t remember it being with us when we got up. 	132
1	6	30	2	We left it behind and he just took it with him instead of leaving it there for someone else to take. 	101
1	6	30	3	I don’t know what was in his mind to do with it.”	49
1	6	31	1	Mary came forward very bravely as she was not accustomed to talking to adults like this at age ten but she was desperately explaining as best as she could despite her own sobs, “Do you mean that pouch?”	202
1	6	32	1	“Yes,” he answered.	19
1	6	33	1	“Not this one?” 	16
1	6	33	2	she practically growled, her cheeks wet with tears but brows furled in anger, distraught with these overbearing men who just knocked out her brother.  	151
1	6	33	3	Mary too was hoping he was just knocked out warm not cold.  	60
1	6	33	4	She wasn’t ready to think of him as dead yet.  	47
1	6	33	5	She looked down at him with her mother holding and rocking him, then at the pouch in the footman’s hands and then at the pouch in her hand and realized how similar they were.  	176
1	6	33	6	She held up the Perkin family’s coin look alike coin pouch.  	61
1	6	33	7	The footmen all looked around at one another in disbelief.  	60
1	6	33	8	Mary was deep in thought considering everything that just took place and then attempted to clear the confusion and calmly explain what she saw must have happened, “He must have thought we left our pouch behind. 	211
1	6	33	9	But we took our own pouch unbeknownst to him and so he might have picked yours up, thinking it was ours.”	105
1	6	34	1	“So tha’ were two bags?” 	25
1	6	34	2	said the brash footman, his black burley brows turning from their usual gruffness to a wide-eyed and dazed look.	112
1	6	35	1	Mary nodded and repeated it to ensure they were seeing what she had, still exasperated, “We sat down to eat together and, if he took it, he couldn’t have taken it from you because he was with me the entire time. 	212
1	6	35	2	You must have left your bag at the table. 	42
1	6	35	3	And as I took ours when we got up, my brother, must have picked up your pouch….by mistake!”	91
1	6	36	1	Mary’s voice started to crack as she looked down at Henry again, his face pale.  	81
1	6	36	2	A sinking feeling came over her that he might be dead. 	55
1	6	36	3	Mary broke but couldn’t say the words, “You hurt  my dear brother Henry! 	73
1	6	36	4	He was innocent!” 	18
1	6	36	5	She couldn’t stop the sobs anymore. 	36
1	6	36	6	“You, you accused him. 	23
1	6	36	7	Accused him falsely….of taking your...your pouch.”	50
1	6	37	1	A sickening realization came over her that she was part to blame.  	67
1	6	37	2	If she hadn’t picked up the pouch for him, he would have seen there were two pouches.  	87
1	6	37	3	Her heart sank further. 	24
1	6	37	4	Emotion weighed heavily.  	26
1	6	37	5	Too many of them all at once. 	30
1	6	37	6	She knelt down at Henry. 	25
1	6	37	7	Lizzie stared angrily at the footmen but was joining everyone at Henry’s side.	78
1	6	38	1	Everything that happened next was a blur of argument, pain, grief and exhaustion for them. 	91
1	6	38	2	When Sergeant John Perkins Sr. came in, he bared his fists and asked what happened.  	85
1	6	38	3	The captain told him that this overzealous footman had struck the boy who was mistaken in picking up a pouch he thought was theirs.  	133
1	6	38	4	Sergeant Perkins mouth dropped with each passing word and red anger flared up. 	79
1	6	38	5	The footman’s face drew his eyes wider in a look of sudden ignorance.  	71
1	6	38	6	Sergeant Perkins stared at his son’s now lifeless body and Judith rocking him hopelessly and then back at the footman. 	119
1	6	38	7	“You killed my son over this tiny pouch of coins?!”	51
1	6	39	1	Before the footman could stammer about it being an accident, he was being pushed, tackled to the ground and grappled and then beaten senseless. 	144
1	6	39	2	He held his arms out to block John’s blows in vain. 	52
1	6	39	3	Their brawl was now taking over the bar, Sergeant Perkins was unleashing fury knocking down chairs, breaking legs on just about every piece of furniture that had legs.  	169
1	6	39	4	He also broke both the man’s forearms, pulled the shoulder out of joint and broke his shin and feet,    rendering him lame for the rest of his life.	148
1	6	40	1	Sergeant Perkins was reprieved of any retribution for the maiming of the footman given he had lost his son. 	108
1	6	40	2	The court case was informal and quick. 	39
1	6	40	3	The other man was never seen on duty again. 	44
1	6	40	4	It was rumored he continued to live in his frailty for the rest of his days well into old age.	94
1	7	1	1	Back home, Judith finally came to terms with the death of her son. 	67
1	7	1	2	Mary still felt a daze over the thought of Henry being dead.  	62
1	7	1	3	She had just seen her grandfather die, now Henry?  	51
1	7	1	4	Everywhere she went, she saw reminders of him, memories of him.  	65
1	7	1	5	She wondered if anyone in the world could resurrect the dead.  	63
1	7	1	6	She couldn’t bring herself to talk about it with anyone. 	57
1	7	1	7	Life seem so suddenly unfair.  	31
1	7	1	8	Judith saw Mary losing her temper, becoming unhinged and cursing.  	67
1	7	1	9	Mary was angry with the gods, the world, everyone and herself. 	63
1	7	1	10	Mary’s depression grew deep to the point of staring into space while milking cows, knocking over milk, and hoping for punishment just to be able to feel again.  	161
1	7	1	11	What kind of world would allow her last grandfather and closest brother Henry to die so quick? 	95
1	7	1	12	Lizzie, being a twin was despondent too.  	42
1	7	1	13	Mary rocked in her bed and did not change out of  her nightgown and wept for hours on end. 	91
1	7	1	14	She tried hard to recall Henry’s last words to her. 	52
1	7	1	15	She held tight to all her last memories with him and went over them, ruminating for hours. 	91
1	7	1	16	When someone broke her train of thought or sought her attention, she would fake a smile to avoid their concern. 	112
1	7	1	17	She was fixated on how strange it was to have someone in your life suddenly go. 	80
1	7	1	18	Lizzie was coming down with a fever and Judith had to get back into action helping her. 	88
1	7	1	19	Judith couldn’t bear the thought of losing Lizzie too.	54
1	8	1	1	The rain beat the rooftops over the Perkin’s home and windows were shuttered and hooked against the winds. 	107
1	8	1	2	Candles were lit all inside and over the hearth during the wake. 	65
1	8	1	3	Judith was first to hear the knock at the door. 	48
1	8	1	4	“John?” 	8
1	8	1	5	she called out in her husband-fetching tone.	44
1	8	2	1	“Hello?” 	9
1	8	2	2	he asked through a crack in the door.	37
1	8	3	1	“I heard the sad news. 	23
1	8	3	2	This is for you.”. 	19
1	8	3	3	He handed John a thin wood box. 	32
1	8	3	4	As John opened it, he saw a large baked item that looks like cake or bread.	75
1	8	4	1	“Thank you, We could sure use this right now.”	46
1	8	5	1	The wet dark haired and lean but strong looking man who looked like he could be an uncle sat down before their fire.	116
1	8	6	1	“You know, I’ve been hoping you could join me at church this Sunday….St. 	73
1	8	6	2	John the Baptist church?”	25
1	8	7	1	“If we are truly cursed, would this be prudent for us to go?	60
1	8	7	2	“ John replied.	15
1	8	8	1	“All of us have seen you grieve and tear your hearts up over the matter of your son. 	85
1	8	8	2	It would be prudent for you to end your mourning and start anew with your living. 	82
1	8	8	3	The sheriff over the ordinaries has restored your pay to what it was since you owed for the damages you dealt him. 	115
1	8	8	4	Your sins are also forgiven.”	29
1	8	9	1	Judith nods to her husband.	27
1	8	10	1	“They also say the Viscount will be there and wants to see you.”	64
1	8	11	1	“Then we will go..”	19
1	8	12	1	“However, the main event will be the memorial for your son. 	60
1	8	12	2	I will count your intended presence there.”	43
1	8	13	1	Mary watched them from the corner of the room. 	47
1	8	13	2	Father cut the bread into portions for the family and guest. 	61
1	8	13	3	Four large portions, a couple medium portions for Mary and Lizzie and a small one for Thomas. 	94
1	8	13	4	Jacob would be getting his milk later that evening.	51
1	9	1	1	Sunday morning arrived with rooks swooping overhead as the Perkins flock came pouring through the double wooden doors of St. 	125
1	9	1	2	John the Baptist church. 	25
1	9	1	3	Sergeant Perkins, Judith and now five children all wore hats and veils. 	72
1	9	1	4	It was customary but the degree to which they lived their customs seemed odd to everyone else. 	95
1	9	1	5	Before the stony chapel, a crew of stable boys was tending to a team of white horses hitched to posts. 	103
1	9	1	6	The stable boys removed their hats in acknowledgment. 	54
1	9	1	7	The interior of the chapel was ornate. 	39
1	9	1	8	A leaded glass window opened to sun.  	38
1	9	1	9	A woody and resinous incense filled the room. 	46
1	9	1	10	Judith thought it smelled of frankincense and pine. 	52
1	9	1	11	The Parson there, wore a gold vestment that seemed even more gaudy than his usual robes. 	89
1	9	1	12	A friar wandered the aisles.	28
1	9	2	1	“Greetings to the family of Sergeant Perkins. 	46
1	9	2	2	The Lord Bless you in coming here this day.”	44
1	9	3	1	As they were seated, their expectations to be offered the Funeral Service from the Book of Common Prayer for Henry’s passing was quickly manifested. 	149
1	9	3	2	Judith had brought her handkerchief with aromatics to revive her or anyone else should she pass out and another cloth to catch the weeping from her eyes. 	154
1	9	3	3	Judith’s sobbing could be heard over the voices in Latin by a chorus of eight older boys singing for Henry. 	108
1	9	3	4	Most of the words were unintelligible Latin followed by some admonition to prayer from what Mary could tell.	108
1	10	1	1	At the end of the service, they exited the chapel to the rose and wildflower ethers of the church yard. 	104
1	10	1	2	A nobleman with a dark felt hat, a thick frilly and bright white neckcloth and a napped black woolen coat approached Judith, the same one she saw earlier at the theatre.  	171
1	10	1	3	He spoke in a softer voice from what she could remember.  	58
1	10	1	4	“I’m so sorry Good Sir, Dear Lady. 	35
1	10	1	5	I originally planned to see my own kin here this day but could not bear to do so with such great loss that so recently happened here and so here I am, in hopes of comforting you.“, Sergeant Perkins straightened himself, as the Viscount of St. 	243
1	10	1	6	Alban looked at him and continued, “Here is something to help with your loss	76
1	10	1	7	.	1
1	10	1	8	 “	2
1	10	2	1	“I beg you, I cannot take it my Lord.” replied Sergeant Perkins.	64
1	10	3	1	“I have to insist. 	19
1	10	3	2	I also have something writings here for you. 	45
1	10	3	3	A copy of a tawdry play of mine, The New Atlantis, the new Holy Bible, some classic works and a treatise for all of us Strangers.”	130
1	10	4	1	A young squire stepped forward with a small wooden chest and handed it over to Sergeant Perkins. 	97
1	10	4	2	It was heavier than he had supposed. 	37
1	10	4	3	He tried to keep his posture and hold back a weak smile as if he had no difficulty lifting it.	94
1	10	5	1	“Knowledge requires much strength, I know.” he said with a smile.	65
1	10	6	1	Johnny gave a weak chuckle, his usual response but now feeling out of place given the mood, still, it had been a while since they had last laughed at anything. 	160
1	10	6	2	The Viscount nodded to him but quickly moved on with a more serious tone, “I’ll have some victuals sent over to your home later.”	129
1	10	7	1	“May I have your lovely children’s names my dear?” 	51
1	10	7	2	he indicated at Judith, almost as if he already knew them and was just making a segue to talk with them.	104
1	10	8	1	“John, Lizzie, Mary, Thomas and Jacob”, she replied matter-of-factly.	69
1	10	9	1	He casually asked each of them questions on their favorite sport and hobby but for Mary he made comment, “What a beautiful girl you are Mary, do you like to read?”	163
1	10	10	1	“Yes my Lord, I can read all the signs in the pub. 	51
1	10	10	2	I read and write a little every day,” she looked at Judith to see if she might have over-stretched her statement, she did and followed up with, “well, almost every day, when I remember to, but I do enjoy it.”	208
1	10	11	1	He chuckled, “Mannered, precocious, honest...”	46
1	10	12	1	“Your mother is a very smart Lady, and you are so much like your mother Mary. 	78
1	10	12	2	Your sister is also very patient and in that there is much wisdom. 	67
1	10	12	3	You’re in good hands, you’ll be looking after them as they look after you.”	75
1	10	13	1	Judith handed him a piece of paper. 	36
1	10	13	2	Mary thought she saw the sketch of the bird she drew earlier. 	62
1	10	13	3	As he looked it over, he looked at Mary and smiled again, “Any time you need some helpful reading, take a look at the little book with the cross on it.”	152
1	10	14	1	Judith took the Viscount aside out of the earshot of the rest.  	64
1	10	14	2	“What did you mean by ‘It’s Mary.’ 	35
1	10	14	3	Francis?”	9
1	10	15	1	“Judith, back there at the theatre, when the dust exploded, several of us saw Mary staring deeply into space, not just staring, but her eyes, her eyes...were...different. 	171
1	10	15	2	We know she’s got your gift.  	30
1	10	15	3	We also know her future is much more perilous.  	48
1	10	15	4	She will be noticed in time by those who would destroy her.  	61
1	10	15	5	If they succeed, her gifts may be lost forever.  	49
1	10	15	6	The power a girl like her possesses is taken to the grave and back again. 	74
1	10	15	7	If they can get her to deny herself, then her soul must take a new course and everything else will be lost.  	109
1	10	15	8	But what’s worst, the world she will help build may fall to tyranny--that same tyranny you see going on now.”	109
1	10	16	1	“What can I do?”	16
1	10	17	1	“There’s not much you can do except to complete the training you would give her anyway. 	88
1	10	17	2	Teach her to stay true to herself at all costs. 	48
1	10	17	3	Don’t let her stray too far from you. 	38
1	10	17	4	Let her know she is important to the rest of us. 	49
1	10	17	5	We will be sending others to watch over her.  	46
1	10	17	6	She will be watched over the rest of her life if need be.  	59
1	10	17	7	The time is coming soon when everything will change.  	54
1	10	17	8	Everything you see before you now will disappear and something else will take its place.”	89
1	10	18	1	Judith’s brow furled in worry again disrupting her older but still pretty face even if it she did color her visage a bit much. 	127
1	10	18	2	He drew his hand over his eye to look at the sun on the horizon and with a sigh. 	81
1	10	18	3	“It would be time to go!” 	26
1	10	18	4	and with that, his retinue gathered around him and whisked him away as almost if he rested on a cloud of velvet caps which is men in waiting wore. 	147
1	10	18	5	The sound of the white horses whinnied in the background and soon his coach was seen stirring up the dust over the greens of the valley. 	137
1	10	18	6	He waved from his coach and everyone waved back at him as he rode through.	74
1	11	1	1	The Perkins home main parlour was filled with children lining up before the dressing screen to devest Sunday’s finery. 	119
1	11	1	2	An impatient Judith forewent changing to crack open this curious little chest. 	79
1	11	1	3	She knew it was unlikely but secretly hoped there might be jewelry with precious gems buried inside somewhere. 	111
1	11	1	4	As it swung open and dust cleared, a neat stack of books materialized. 	71
1	11	1	5	One of them was Cicero. 	24
1	11	1	6	Beneath it, The New Atlantis, The Holy Bible, Hamlet, The Tiller then the mysterious little book with the cross on it. 	119
1	11	1	7	She cracked it open. 	21
1	11	1	8	The initials R.C. appeared on it. 	34
1	11	1	9	There were alchemical pictures and a series of seventy and fifty spells in Latin each with prologues and epilogues. 	116
1	11	1	10	There was a list of scientific laws and then this creed:	56
1	11	2	1	Love God above all.	19
1	11	3	1	Devote your time to your spiritual advancement	46
1	11	4	1	Be entirely unselfish	21
1	11	5	1	Be temperate, modest, energetic, and silent	43
1	11	6	1	Learn to know the origins of the metals contained within thyself	64
1	11	7	1	Beware of quacks and pretenders	31
1	11	8	1	Live in constant adoration of the highest good	46
1	11	9	1	Learn the theory before you attempt the practice	48
1	11	10	1	Exercise charity towards all beings	35
1	11	11	1	Read the ancient books of wisdom	32
1	11	12	1	Try to understand their secret meaning.	39
1	11	13	1	Below that was a penned passage:	32
1	11	14	1	To Mary, I hope this serves you well. 	38
1	11	14	2	F.B.	4
1	11	15	1	In the bottom corner of the box they received was a tiny stained wooden box with checker patterns on it looking like alabaster and ivory. 	138
1	11	15	2	Judith’s eyes lit up. 	22
1	11	15	3	On it was a family crest with a red shield, chiefed in white with two pierced black stars crested with a boar passant in blue ermine. 	134
1	11	15	4	It was the most ornate little box any of them had laid eyes on. 	64
1	11	15	5	A little string and a note was attached the lip of the box. 	60
1	11	15	6	As Judith picked up the box and read the note, her eyes widened and her mouth dropped, her eyes moving back and forth rapidly which indicated to everyone she was reading and then re-reading being it was such a small note. 	222
1	11	15	7	Her expression diminishing stare seemed to depict fear more than hope.  	72
1	11	15	8	Mary looked panicked. 	22
1	11	15	9	What did it say?	16
2	1	1	1	Mary was at the butter churn and Elizabeth was spinning at the spinning wheel by the fire as the sun set.  	107
2	1	1	2	The box was on the table with the slip of paper.	48
2	1	3	1	It read in tiny print:	22
2	1	5	1	When on the cheeks of a presbytery,	35
2	1	6	1	The double snakes do show a sign to thee;	41
2	1	7	1	Take up thine house and with thy family sail	44
2	1	8	1	A year wait not or peril will prevail	37
2	1	9	1	And when the queen is checked by knights a-pair	47
2	1	10	1	Then case will breach and rook will capture there.	50
2	1	11	1	DO NOT OPEN!	12
2	1	13	1	Judith could feel the danger in it’s tone and was suddenly aware of its implication that they would have to leave all behind and sail the dangerous seas and take this Box of Pandora with them as their sole protection.  	219
2	1	13	2	The prospect of war and more losses loomed in those subtle chess play references as Judith had read so much before.  	117
2	1	13	3	The past few years had been hectic with religious quarrels and just this last summer, the prophecy had come true.  	115
2	1	13	4	Doctor and Presbyterian preacher Alexander Leighton was branded on the cheeks for writing a controversial pamphlet that labeled him a “Sower of Sedition” and thus he was disfigured with the letters SS or as was hinted, two snakes. 	231
2	1	13	5	Judith felt sympathy for him and the Presbyterians in general despite her perceptions of the Scottish.  	104
2	1	13	6	He was, after all, a doctor. 	29
2	1	13	7	Now, they only had a year left to leave and many had already started since His Majesty had disbanded Parliament, essentially ignoring the voice of the people and running the kingdom under.	188
2	1	14	1	Her son John, already 21, was courting a girl and he would have to leave her behind. 	85
2	1	14	2	Elizabeth however was too giddy about leaving.  	48
2	1	14	3	Judith was afraid she’d become the typical “spinster”. 	55
2	1	14	4	Judith had always felt up to this point that Mary was too young for all of that despite the fact it was common for girls to run off with some wealthy Lord. 	156
2	1	14	5	The boys were taking up most of her time and needing much discipline in between baking through the harsh cold storms.	117
2	1	15	1	“Mother, when are we leaving?”	30
2	1	16	1	“As soon the Lyon or some ship arrives Lizzie, I keep telling you! 	67
2	1	16	2	Mind your Mother when she tells you these things.  	51
2	1	16	3	The Good Lord willing, it will be this month.”	46
2	1	17	1	“My friends were showing me the finest cotton and there is all kinds of warm fur, there’s silver, gold, jewelry!.  	115
2	1	17	2	Oh and so much sugar and candy you could open your own candy shoppe!”	69
2	1	18	1	“Lizzie, those are all wonderful but I hear it’s also very dangerous!  	71
2	1	18	2	Although, the way things are going now, I can’t say it’s safe here!”	68
2	1	19	1	John chimed in now: “Mom, you wouldn’t believe that there are so many wild stags there, you could eat stew and pies all day just by walking out your door and taking one down in the morning!”	190
2	1	20	1	Judith could tell they were hungry.  	37
2	1	20	2	They had plenty but it was packed and waiting. 	47
2	1	20	3	They’d carry some of their own provisions on board. 	52
2	1	20	4	She didn’t quite trust the provisions they’d supply on ship and she wanted a sure option for her family.	104
2	1	21	1	Thomas, in his soft little voice spoke: “I want a pipe like the doctors have”	77
2	1	22	1	“Thomas, that’s just a silly vanity!  	38
2	1	22	2	We need not do like those doctors. ”	36
2	1	23	1	The loudest door creak suddenly split the air and a giant gust of cold snow blew in sputtering snowflakes that quickly melted wet onto them.  	142
2	1	23	2	Big leathery boots stomped and the door slammed shut with another quick and loud ear piercing Creeeeak!	103
2	1	24	1	It was soon apparent the cause of such a sudden burst.  	56
2	1	24	2	Sergeant John Perkins announced, “It’s here! 	45
2	1	24	3	We’re leaving!”	15
2	1	25	1	The sudden realization made Elizabeth visibly gulp.  	53
2	1	25	2	She was suddenly excited and fearful at the same time.  	56
2	1	25	3	While she wanted the luxuries all the girls were chattering about, she felt a sudden sink in her belly as she realized she would be leaving home…..home, indefinitely.  	168
2	1	25	4	It felt like it had just occurred to her that she would go alright but never get to parade any of it to her friends.  	118
2	1	25	5	She would miss them terribly.	29
2	1	26	1	That week they filled cases and odd boxes full of clothing, firkins of butter, dried cakes, honey, fruit preserves, a barrel of well-salted pork, cutlery, pots, dried meats, cheeses, wines and a cask of ale the next several days.  	231
2	1	26	2	John made a neat bill of all the goods he wanted to take but even with all their preparation, they had forgotten a lot of little things.  	138
2	1	26	3	John had to sell his home at a discount to the neighbors whose son had just married that last Sunday.  	103
2	1	26	4	He had used the farm home to pay the harbormaster in Bristol for his family’s passage to Boston. 	97
2	1	26	5	Just in time to move in, he thought to himself. 	48
2	1	26	6	But with that, he chuckled to himself thinking what a mess it might be that he’d have to move into.  	101
2	1	26	7	He would be going to a beautiful new alien land of opportunity with new peoples and animals and mountains of gold to be found. 	127
2	1	26	8	He had to either butcher or sell off his animals this week.  	61
2	1	26	9	He hated the task but diligently gave thanks to his Father in Heaven and Mother in Earth for the Providence shown to him as he looked up to the solar fiery orb in the clouds above.	180
2	1	27	1	They went to the tavern next to sell the last of the animals, egg laying ducks, their sheep and goat dog, a couple egg laying chickens, and one of last year’s calves and picked up fresh spices, all kinds of powders and salts from the apothecary, new wools, new boots and flasks with cords. 	290
2	1	27	2	Elizabeth was especially thrilled with the chance to go on the shopping spree of her life and say goodbye to their friends.  	125
2	1	27	3	Finally, John scheduled the coaches and carts to come by and take them and their family’s last remnants of wealth with them to Bristol in early February.	153
2	1	28	1	Mary was busy helping mom pack and prepare the last of the meat which they needed to cure before their coaches arrived.  	121
2	1	28	2	Judith put the little box from the Viscount in her pocket for good luck.  	74
2	1	28	3	Elizabeth packed her spinning wheel and chair. 	47
2	1	28	4	John packed hunting knives and spears.  	40
2	1	28	5	Thomas and Jacob had hobby horses.  	36
2	1	28	6	Then they waited...in part due to the exhaustion they were all having but also because the coaches were running late due to bad weather.  	138
2	1	28	7	John was sent up the road to the top of the hill to keep an eye out for them.  	79
2	1	28	8	After a morning of waiting, they quickly got bored and went to work doing a final sweep and looking over their home. 	117
2	1	28	9	Every so often they’d listen for John.  	40
2	1	28	10	John came back that evening with sullen disappointment.  	57
2	1	28	11	They took to lighting a fire and then took to bed with their cloaks and a shared bedpan which they passed around to stay warm.  	128
2	1	28	12	They awoke again to a chilly, clear, ice and frost morning and John went on the lookout.  	90
2	1	28	13	Mary had already started opening one of their smaller boxes for some dried meat, bread and butter.  	100
2	1	28	14	Just before noon, the coach could be seen bouncing along the road at a slow pace.	81
2	1	29	1	“They’re here! 	15
2	1	29	2	They’re here!”	14
2	1	29	3	, shouted John and everyone ran up to greet him.  	50
2	1	29	4	Soon Mary was helped up onto the coach while John Sr and John Jr. were packing up the one wagon.  	98
2	1	29	5	Here, they would hop from inn to inn in the cold month of January.	66
2	1	30	1	As they arrived in Bristol, they were immediately greeted and given a day of rest for their travels.  	102
2	1	30	2	Judith, Elizabeth and Mary had a chance to meet Rebecca Throckmorton in the nursery room.  	91
2	1	30	3	Rebecca was Elizabeth’s age and they instantly hit it off.  	60
2	1	30	4	Rebecca was a beautiful girl with rosy cheeks and porcelain complexion and a cheerful smile.  	94
2	1	30	5	She had the most beautiful dresses of dark reds and blues.  	60
2	1	30	6	Her husband by common law John soon came along to pick her up.  	64
2	1	30	7	They were packing the ship full of provisions, requested supplies from the colony, and working day and night under the loud voice of Captain Pierce.  	150
2	1	30	8	There were huge barrels of beer, and others of all different sizes, bushels of oatmeal, all kinds of salted fish, casks of butter and cheese that looked like it outweighed the passengers, rumlets of imported wines, a hogshead of beef per person.  	247
2	1	30	9	There were only a handful of sailors, a quartermaster was carefully checking the goods as they came on board.  	111
2	1	30	10	Others helped to lower them into the bottom of the ship.  	58
2	1	30	11	When it got dark, candlelight was seen and the fife could be heard trilling happy tunes while deep voices soulfully droned the tunes of their shanties.	151
2	1	31	1	The morning arrived when they’d be boarding.  	46
2	1	31	2	There was expected many more passengers but the cold weather had prevented them from boarding.  	96
2	1	31	3	The brass of bells could be heard ringing and people scurried to the gangplank and onto the main deck.  	104
2	1	31	4	Captain Pierce, a very fatherly and neatly dressed man greeted them cheerfully on board.  	90
2	1	31	5	Then, in a gruffer voice, he bellowed: “Waylon!”	48
2	1	32	1	“Aye Captain!”	14
2	1	32	2	, a wiry lad with ripped arms stepped out and snapped into place. 	66
2	1	32	3	He looked fiercely cool, hard jaw but soft red slightly cracked lips. 	70
2	1	32	4	His muscled arms were tanned deep olive brown. 	47
2	1	32	5	Deep blue eyes pierced out of locks of wavy black hair that he swung out of the way by cocking his head back. 	110
2	1	32	6	Mary and Elizabeth both locked their gaze at him.	49
2	1	33	1	“Show these gentle folks to their cabins.”	42
2	1	34	1	“Aye aye Captain”, he smiled given that he had never done this duty before.  	77
2	1	34	2	A boatswain was often too busy with the sails but they were short staffed.  	76
2	1	34	3	Some of the sailors would stay behind to do repairs.  	54
2	1	34	4	Waylon was the youngest and most enthusiastic member of the crew at nineteen years.	83
2	1	35	1	Judith had to push her girls forward to start them up the ramp and to catch up with her husband who had his two boys on each side. 	131
2	1	35	2	Judith had a half smile planted and made subtle eye-roll  as she realized what her daughters were dumbfounded over.  	117
2	1	35	3	John Jr. hinted earlier with an audible stomp on the ramp which shook it slightly.	82
2	1	36	1	They went onto the main deck and down the ladder and into the cabins.   	72
2	1	36	2	It smelled damp with mildew. 	29
2	1	36	3	The sound of cargo shifting and hammers came from the floor below and the craft bobbed ever so slightly as they landed on the deck below. 	138
2	1	36	4	A spare cabin was pointed out.	30
2	1	37	1	“Reverend, this cabin will be yours.”	37
2	1	38	1	There were open pads of bedding laying around which seemed to be fore the servants.  	85
2	1	38	2	There were curtains for a changing room along with a sign.  	60
2	1	38	3	From below, an older stocky man with a beard came up from the holding deck and rasped:  “We’re all tight mate.”	111
2	1	39	1	“Superb Jake, tell Captain” replied Waylon. 	44
2	1	39	2	Even though Waylon was his junior and weaker, Jake the Dutchman had a servile demeanor and habitually ducked his head in acknowledgement as he ascended into the skylit port to the main deck. 	191
2	1	39	3	Waylon looked older and more menacing in the dark with the few windows lighting the scene.  	92
2	1	39	4	His manly voice and strikingly handsome face was even more pronounced to Mary who breathed a deep sigh.  	105
2	1	39	5	Her mind started to drift into a sensual place she hadn’t felt in such a way before. 	85
2	1	39	6	Waylon gazed back at her for a moment, their eyes locked and she suddenly felt a panic and glanced away.  	106
2	1	39	7	He continued to stare at her.  	31
2	1	39	8	His dark mustache and eyebrows punctuated a little bit of longing before he too broke away and continued in speech to the other guests.  	137
2	1	39	9	She couldn’t hear what the words were, her mind was so entangled with his sheer majesty and confidence.  	105
2	1	39	10	The last words he said rung in her head “Good Day Fair Ladies and Gentle Lords”, sounding almost a bit too impressive raising the corners of her mouth into a slight grin of feeling like maybe she could entrance him again.	221
2	1	40	1	She could hear commands above as soon as he rose out.  	55
2	1	40	2	She thought she heard a  “Fend off.” 	37
2	1	40	3	“Bend the jib”, “Furl the main”, “Weigh anchor, “Set the sails”, “Anchor’s aweigh” among some high pitched whistles mixed with Waylon’s voice.	142
2	1	41	1	They all let their satchels and parcels and belongings drop.  	62
2	1	41	2	Judith held her sons and helped them to nap, putting the mystery box in a makeshift inner pocket she was used to sewing into clothes, just inside her skirt.  	158
2	1	41	3	The boys took off their shoes and jumped on the bedding in their stockings.	75
2	1	42	1	There was a lot of running heard overhead and the passengers were huddled out of the way, waiting in the dark, sometimes spotting a rat or a pair of glowing eyes.	162
2	1	43	1	Another deep whistle was heard and Mary went to the window, seeing the water pick up a rapid pace outside and rattling through the chop, the icy wind draft foreboding of the likely sniffles to come.  	200
2	1	43	2	Her stomach went into a knot, feeling much like the cables and ropes outside. 	78
2	1	43	3	John and Judith pulled her down.  	34
2	1	43	4	Elizabeth had left to chat with Rebecca. 	41
2	1	43	5	John was out touring the boat. 	31
2	1	43	6	John was the curious adventure lover as usual.	46
2	1	44	1	As she went up to the main deck, she saw Waylon, staring at the sails, continuing to watch them for any ill sign, listening to the yards creak and the billows ruffling with the fortunate gusts of air they started. 	214
2	1	44	2	He was seated, fanning his legs and humming a tune. 	52
2	1	44	3	He smiled at her.	17
2	1	45	1	Mary went into a blush for being so noticed.  	46
2	1	45	2	Seeing this, he pulled back his gaze and lofted his eyes towards the sails again as if intently needing to watch for lightning strikes.  	137
2	1	45	3	Mary couldn’t help but look him over, from boot to neck with the corner of her eye while pretending to glance away.  	117
2	1	45	4	His boots were leather, scuffed and dampened with soot and oils and split brandy.  	83
2	1	45	5	His pants were loose and going threadbare from the elements. 	61
2	1	45	6	She couldn’t help but notice his manhood, defined just enough through the cloth so that she could see its shapes juggled by his legs that  continued their rhythm.  	164
2	1	45	7	She felt an instant pang of guilt but it also set her lustful passions aflame.  	80
2	1	45	8	She forced her eyes shut a moment and continued to look at his belt flat over his belly, a buckle in place.  	109
2	1	45	9	His shirt was loose also and had a small tear on the arm outside.  	67
2	1	45	10	It revealed his collar, his sinewed shoulders and soft black tufts on his muscular chest. 	90
2	1	45	11	He had a visible Adam’s apple and she saw him gulp just then which broke her gaze thinking he might notice her ogling him.  	124
2	1	45	12	He was still looking up and away. 	34
2	1	45	13	She looked at his hands, rough and thick, calloused to match the many ropes would throw and pull about.  	105
2	1	45	14	Mere seconds of taking it all in was enough time for him to stand up and shake his clothing loose about him.	108
2	1	46	1	He bowed, “Little Miss”.	24
2	1	47	1	She was disappointed at that, she suddenly felt five years younger but gave a quick curtsey which seemed to catch his eye and make him gulp again.  	148
2	1	47	2	“Sir” she replied.	18
2	1	48	1	It also felt wrong.  	21
2	1	48	2	He broke a smile and went to climb up a rope.  	47
2	1	48	3	She watched him in awe, taking in the view of a man she was very heavily lusting for and who seemed to return the favor.  	122
2	1	48	4	She wasn’t used to this attention and feeling.  	48
2	1	48	5	It burned her inside, feeling instantly painful like the heartbreak of death and yet so hopeful.  	98
2	1	48	6	Her heart danced wildly inside her, as if to play a temptress that she could barely keep locked inside the cage of her chest. 	126
2	1	48	7	That would doom her.  	22
2	1	48	8	She knew it was a very forbidden feeling but here she was, old enough to be married, and here was an ocean of water from which she couldn’t drink in her mind.  	160
2	1	48	9	What would her mother think of her falling in love with this boy?  	67
2	1	48	10	He might have been a Spaniard from his looks.  	47
2	1	48	11	His features contrasted much more than hers.  	46
2	1	48	12	His eyes were soulful despite his otherwise hardset chiseled looks. 	68
2	1	48	13	His smile soft.  	17
2	1	48	14	Was he really as fascinated with her as she was with him?	57
2	1	49	1	“Mary!?” 	9
2	1	49	2	came a shout.	13
2	1	50	1	Mary ran over to what she considered an inconspicuous, do nothing spot on the ship away from everyone and looked out to the sea as she heard mom climbing the ladder. 	166
2	1	50	2	Waylon looked down and took notice.  	37
2	1	50	3	He realized her mother was coming up and became busy with the sails but sneaking a glance down.  	97
2	1	50	4	He saw her fair arms and neck which were so dainty compared to his. 	68
2	1	50	5	When mom came up, Mary walked towards her.	42
2	1	51	1	“We have to wash up for dinner.”	32
2	1	52	1	“Come quick, they’re showing us where to hang our laundry and where to find the soap.”	86
2	1	53	1	“She left in mom’s hand and then took a last look at Waylon who was now preoccupied.”	85
2	1	54	1	“More than anything she longed for him.  	41
2	1	54	2	Food was burdensome to her new daydreams.  	43
2	1	54	3	She thought what it might be like to kiss him on the lips.”	59
2	1	55	1	“Mary, what is it?”	19
2	1	56	1	Her stare was distant and looked to Judith as if she was staring at a bird falling from the sky. 	97
2	1	56	2	Mary came to and picked up where she left off.  	48
2	1	56	3	She knew Judith knew what was happening somehow.  	50
2	1	56	4	“I know it’s a huge ship and a lot to take in Mary.”  	54
2	1	56	5	Judith was now helping to cover for her obvious love trance.	60
2	1	57	1	At dinner, Mary could barely eat or think.  	44
2	1	57	2	Who could she talk to?  	24
2	1	57	3	The biscuits were hard and dry and tasted old.  	48
2	1	57	4	She drank her ale and gave her brother John the rest of her bread.  	68
2	1	57	5	He finished it in no time. 	27
2	1	57	6	John and his hollow legs she thought.	37
2	1	58	1	As it got dark, she heard a whistle for the passengers to come up to main deck. 	80
2	1	58	2	One of the few whistles the passengers had learned.  	53
2	1	58	3	Captain Pierce was there explaining how life would be different, how God’s infinite Wisdom had guided him on these seas many years since the Mayflower, how he felt it was a great Blessing but that he was not the best to speak on such things and so he introduced Reverend Williams.  	282
2	1	58	4	Reverend Williams gave an impassioned speech that was very novel.  	67
2	1	58	5	He spoke of a new start, a new relationship with God and a new church. 	71
2	1	58	6	Towards the end, it went into a teacher and student question and answer mode.  	79
2	1	58	7	They got a feel for his leanings.	33
2	1	59	1	When the Reverend asked if he was a Quaker he said “No.”. 	58
2	1	59	2	This was John Throckmorton..who was ruggedly handsome.  	56
2	1	59	3	Mary thought he would be dreamy enough if she hadn’t just seen the most handsome man she had ever laid eyes on. 	112
2	1	59	4	He was the kind of man Mary thought most people might expect her to marry when she was older.  	95
2	1	59	5	Judith tried to avoid the topic.  	34
2	1	59	6	When Elizabeth had once mentioned boys, Judith would tell her in a stern voice “No, no, you are too young!  	108
2	1	59	7	Only when a man approaches a lady’s parents should she even consider him!”  	76
2	1	59	8	This seemed very unreasonable to Mary but Elizabeth seemed resigned to accept it and it now seemed she would never have the chance.	131
2	1	60	1	Reverend Roger Williams was a gaunt, tall man but with a round face, premature greys silvering his once darker hair.  	118
2	1	60	2	He wasn’t wearing a wig of any kind like she would expect. 	59
2	1	60	3	He had a small collar on and a cane that he would tap on the deck, irritating the crew.  	89
2	1	60	4	Still, he was kind and grandfatherly.  	39
2	1	60	5	She had a sudden thought of her own grandfather.  	50
2	1	60	6	His hair was cropped in front and long in back but his face more sucken and older. 	83
2	1	60	7	He had a dark waistcoat on with buttons, well protected from the elements as it seemed stuffed with layers of clothing. 	120
2	1	60	8	He ended his sermon with admonitions after a lot of whispers in the crowd.  	76
2	1	60	9	One of his admonitions was that the kingdom of God should never succumb to any other kingdom on this earth, that the two had very different meanings.  	151
2	1	60	10	He took out the new official King James bible and read the passages where Jesus answered Pontius Pilate:  My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight.	202
2	1	61	1	John Throckmorton threw his hands up and applauded, prompting the crew to do so too.  	86
2	1	61	2	The crew seemed a little tired of sermons and welcomed the lively change of mood.  	83
2	1	61	3	Mary remembered the initiation she had received from Judith.  	62
2	1	61	4	She agreed.  	13
2	1	61	5	Wherever she would be lead to now, she would not want to see the affairs of corrupt kings and leaders polluting the pristine truth and holy sanctuary of deity.  	161
2	1	61	6	She wanted to see a day when a person’s devotions were not checked by the leaders of this earth.  	98
2	1	61	7	She saw another family there.  	31
2	1	61	8	The Onge family headed by Edmond Onge and she saw a man who introduced himself to the congregation as Mr. 	106
2	1	61	9	Parke who was quiet and kept to himself.  	42
2	1	61	10	Mr. 	4
2	1	61	11	Parke was also regularly tired from having drink. 	50
2	1	61	12	Mary thought to herself that he might just drink the ship dry before they got to Boston and end up trying to sleep through it within the cradling arms of Insobriety.	165
2	1	62	1	After such a serious sermon, John and Judith were ready for something lighter.  	80
2	1	62	2	The sailors came out and put on a little show, told stories, played music and otherwise played the wags with them through an endless night.  	141
2	1	62	3	Before long almost everyone was doubled up in laughter and enjoying drink.  	76
2	1	62	4	Reverend Williams, trying to maintain his reputation abstained from strong drink and opted for a very light beer instead and avoided being overly entertained, seeming as if he felt a bit upstaged. 	197
2	1	62	5	He’d crack a light grin or chuckle but he was not the type to hoot or holler.	77
2	1	63	1	Mary enjoyed every moment of romantic singing, comedic songs, some of which mocked the other kings and other ships of the Winthrop fleet.  	139
2	1	63	2	There was a ditty about the sad fate the a sister ship, The Ambrose which suffered critical damage to her mast.  	113
2	1	63	3	She watched steadfastly when Waylon came up to play the fife.  	63
2	1	63	4	His trills of notes sent shivers up her spine and at times, she saw him smiling at her as if playing his song just for her.  	125
2	1	63	5	She felt embarrassed.  	23
2	1	63	6	Why hadn't she put on her most beautiful gown that night?  	59
2	1	63	7	Even though he was dressed as but a sailor, a lowly coxswain or some such to her father, she wanted him as if he were ‘her king’.	129
2	1	64	1	“The older adults” of her family and the Throckmortons were engaging in conversation as the music faded into the background.  	126
2	1	64	2	The two boys were checked on periodically.  	44
2	1	64	3	Amongst the random laughter, stories and jibber jabber, Mary saw an opportunity.  	82
2	1	64	4	Judith threw Mary a glare of caution but seeing Waylon as a kind, handsome respectable boy, she decided it was futile and thought back to her own teen years….not so restrictive and much younger than the would like to admit. 	224
2	1	64	5	Still, Judith was a woman who had mistakes under her belt and didn’t want to see her daughters fall into that same trap.  	122
2	1	64	6	Ever since Henry’s death, Judith had become more overprotective, walking them hand in hand everywhere.  	104
2	1	64	7	But after tonight, Judith’s guard was down.  	45
2	1	64	8	They were on a boat, the most dangerous thing possible in her mind and nothing was amiss.  	91
2	1	64	9	They were cold but warmed by passing around hot bricks and hot pans and irons, holding them to their clothes.	109
2	1	65	1	Mary noticed Waylon was dressed with much thicker clothing as the cold night wore on.  	87
2	1	65	2	The Captain had retired to a cabin above the main deck, filled with maps and navigation devices and a telescope.  	114
2	1	65	3	After Waylon had played his fife for the last time that night, he waved on the Dutchman who was probably a very talented singer once upon a time if it weren't’ for his raspy voice. 	181
2	1	65	4	Waylon approached Mary who was Waylon’s lone captive audience member.  	71
2	1	65	5	Most others were content to socialize during his number.  	58
2	1	65	6	A bit of nervousness broke from usual composure.  	50
2	1	65	7	“Good evening Miss Perkins”.  	30
2	1	65	8	“Good evening…” (Mary faked not knowing his name not wanting to appear overly eager. 	85
2	1	65	9	Mom had mentioned what hard-to-get was about) “Waylon”,	55
2	1	66	1	“Good evening Waylon”.	22
2	1	67	1	“Did you enjoy my song?” 	25
2	1	67	2	...Mary heard the accent come out here and it enlivened her even more, making it even harder to control her desire.	115
2	1	68	1	“It was very lovely. 	21
2	1	68	2	But please….”, she paused in teasing., “call me Mary.” and they both grinned wide sharing her little joke.	106
2	1	69	1	“My song I am afraid is not charming at all…”	45
2	1	70	1	Mary now took the bait. 	24
2	1	70	2	“oh?”	5
2	1	71	1	“compared to you.”	18
2	1	72	1	He grinned wider making her blush and this time, they both knew something was happening.  	90
2	1	72	2	She could sense him and she suddenly felt so lucky to be talking to him, him returning her attention. 	102
2	1	72	3	His commanding exterior ceased intimidating her although it was that which made her burn so badly for him.	106
2	1	73	1	“You look cold.”	16
2	1	74	1	She was shivering more from the excitement more than the cold.  	64
2	1	74	2	As he laid a woolen cloak across their shoulders, she felt an even greater shiver.  	84
2	1	74	3	She caught his mouth dropping, even drooled a drop.  	53
2	1	74	4	He turned a little red.  	25
2	1	74	5	He put a hand over her shoulder.  	34
2	1	74	6	It was a rougher hand than she imagined.  	42
2	1	74	7	It was warmer and rougher than the wool...more like his old weathered boots or the ropes that held the sails up. 	113
2	1	74	8	She imagined him wearing those all day and sweating in them.  	62
2	1	74	9	She sniffed as if she were cold but was taking in his scent...it was warm like bread with pepper and sage and the musk you could only find on a mature and virile man.  	168
2	1	74	10	She felt shy.  	15
2	1	74	11	He wasn’t very talkative now.  	31
2	1	74	12	She wanted him to speak so she could hear that voice but she didn’t want to lose his touch.  	93
2	1	74	13	She felt her heart squirming as he wrapped his muscled arms around her soft, pale and dainty arms. 	99
2	1	74	14	He held her cheek into his chest and she was overwhelmed...hearing his heartbeat.  	83
2	1	74	15	The tufts of hair on his chest were soft on her face as if she had put a rabbit fur on her pillow.  	100
2	1	74	16	She could also tell this was starting to excite him but he just held her close, embracing her and she could hear him sniffing gently.  	135
2	1	74	17	She wondered if her hair would smell sweet like the lavenders, lilacs and field violets she had put in her hair as a habit.	123
2	1	75	1	He sighed and took a step back.  	33
2	1	75	2	“I am surprised.”	17
2	1	76	1	“Oh?”	5
2	1	77	1	“That you would surpass my best dream of what beauty is”	56
2	1	78	1	Now he was hooked.  	20
2	1	78	2	What had she gotten herself into?  	35
2	1	78	3	She was also amazed that this could be happening to her.  	58
2	1	78	4	Is this how all love starts out?  	34
2	1	78	5	She couldn’t speak.  	21
2	1	78	6	It was too much.  	18
2	1	78	7	He reflected back everything she was feeling and suddenly she realized that words couldn’t do this feeling justice. ..but she must do something….to show appreciation and yet modesty here.	187
2	1	79	1	“I’m just a girl from the country.  	36
2	1	79	2	I am just a curious girl, is that what you are seeing?”	55
2	1	80	1	“No, I saw you first, I watched you from the stern and borrowed the telescope to see who this beautiful lady was..”	115
2	1	81	1	She felt oddly forgiving of his confession and flattered that he finally referred to her as a lady.  	101
2	1	81	2	She couldn’t say how she felt about his looks, she could only speak it by responding with her walk and gesture. 	112
2	1	81	3	He didn’t seem too clueless that she liked him back.  	54
2	1	81	4	He didn’t ask and she hoped she would never have to admit it.  	63
2	1	81	5	It’s one of those things only another girl, or rather, lady,  could understand.  	81
2	1	81	6	It seemed to cheapen it for her to reveal it.  	47
2	1	81	7	That was her understanding of the role she had to play.  	57
2	1	81	8	She was starting to learn quick.  	34
2	1	81	9	She was now curious though about him and she was afraid he might never totally reveal his heart to him.  	105
2	1	81	10	She needed it.	14
2	1	82	1	“Do tell me good shipmate, how long have you been sailing?  	60
2	1	82	2	Will we be safe?”	17
2	1	83	1	“Oh, since I was fourteen years old, I was sailing.  	53
2	1	83	2	I met Captain Pierce as an orphan, who stole his food from the docks. 	70
2	1	83	3	He took pity on me. 	20
2	1	83	4	He made me work off my debts for what I stole from him.  	57
2	1	83	5	He’s a very strict man but a fair man.  	40
2	1	83	6	He is cruel with those who should know him well enough and continue to disrespect him.  	88
2	1	83	7	I was flogged every day on my first trip.”	42
2	1	84	1	“Oh, you can’t be telling me this!”	35
2	1	85	1	“But it was only a couple times every day and very lightly.”	60
2	1	86	1	“He passed a harsh sentence on me but then he tired of his punishing and only did the merest obligation to it to maintain his integrity and conscience.  	153
2	1	86	2	He told me he hated it but to tell no one else because if they did find out his mercy, it might be used to take advantage of him.  	131
2	1	86	3	I even yelled loudly in agony so others would see the seriousness of his words.  	81
2	1	86	4	I was grateful and so I’ve returned a favor to him.”	52
2	1	87	1	“I am still sorry he did that to you.”	38
2	1	88	1	“Don’t be.  	12
2	1	88	2	I haven’t suffered for it ever since that first month..”	56
2	1	89	1	“Month?!”	9
2	1	90	1	“Now I’m playing the wags with you, I meant days.”	50
2	1	91	1	“He really is an upright man and the best captain I’ve ever known.”	67
2	1	92	1	“Where did you come from?”	26
2	1	93	1	“I don’t know, I was told when I was old enough to remember that they saw my parents drop me off there when I was old enough to run.”	133
2	1	94	1	“Oh that’s even worse Waylon”	29
2	1	95	1	“I only remember that my parents fought with me that day.  	59
2	1	95	2	They yelled at me, they threatened me.  	40
2	1	95	3	I can no longer speak their language.  	39
2	1	95	4	I had to learn English to survive.  	36
2	1	95	5	I listened to people all day, finding out what I could so I could be like them.  	81
2	1	95	6	They said things they thought I couldn’t understand.  	54
2	1	95	7	But I did understand so I knew where they were hiding things.  	63
2	1	95	8	I knew who would be arriving and how much money they had.  	59
2	1	95	9	If they had a lot, I might be lucky enough to take something”	61
2	1	96	1	Mary started to feel a little anger.  	38
2	1	96	2	How could she be so in love with a boy who was a thief.  	57
2	1	96	3	A boy who actually did the things her laid to rest brother had been falsely accused of?  	89
2	1	96	4	She felt so much confusion in her heart but she tried to fight it.	66
2	1	97	1	“But you learned your lesson after you met Captain Pierce right?”	65
2	1	97	2	, Mary now only realized that he had taken her to the galley, the scent of cooking pork was rich in here.  	107
2	1	97	3	They were alone.	16
2	1	98	1	He nodded as if to realize that what he had just said might have ruined his chances with her.  	95
2	1	98	2	She saw in him a villain but one who had turned around.  	57
2	1	98	3	She couldn’t help but feel a deep curiosity about this mysterious man with a long tragic history.  	99
2	1	98	4	He looked irresistible again. 	30
2	1	98	5	How fickle of me she thought to herself.  	42
2	1	98	6	She noticed how his story made her feel. 	41
2	1	98	7	He successfully stirred up the bad boy lust in her.  	53
2	1	98	8	Was he lying?  	15
2	1	98	9	She now didn’t care.  	22
2	1	98	10	She put her mind to rest and she then saw his eyes staring into hers.  	71
2	1	98	11	They were honest, gentle, sweet.  	34
2	1	98	12	She locked again into his, starting to shiver a little.  	57
2	1	98	13	She couldn’t control it.  	26
2	1	98	14	He pulled her in some more but not tightly.  	45
2	1	98	15	She looked at his lips and he looked at hers and they knew something at that moment.	84
2	1	99	1	Before she could think another thought, his lips and hers were pressed together.  	82
2	1	99	2	She had abandoned her mind and there was nothing but feeling.  	63
2	1	99	3	At first, just a soft press and then, a light lick and his tongue pressed in between her lips.  	96
2	1	99	4	Her eyes closed and she felt herself spin with the earth and sky.  	67
2	1	99	5	The world closed deep on itself and she was embraced in his dark warmth.  	74
2	1	99	6	His wavy hair covered her cheeks.  	35
2	1	99	7	Their tongues slid deeply past each other and they shared a deep mouth-watering kiss, full of the wildness of adulthood, the feral side of their human natures.  	161
2	1	99	8	She let go further.  	21
2	1	99	9	She thought he might take it further.  	39
2	1	99	10	Looking back, she was glad she didn’t encourage it.  	53
2	1	99	11	The lights were blown out and they both noticed the dark.  	59
2	1	99	12	Mary might be in trouble. 	26
2	1	99	13	He took her by the hand and said, “I’m sorry we have to part here.” and guided her to the ladder.  	99
2	1	99	14	She went down the ladder, snores were heard.  	46
2	1	99	15	Judith had an eye open apparently.  	36
2	1	99	16	She felt a smack on the bottom and she was pushed to the floor and tucked in with a motherly force.	99
2	1	100	1	Mary’s head spun itself into a dizziness that slowly lulled her to sleep.	73
2	1	101	1	For days, the cold snap chilled the boat below freezing.  	58
2	1	101	2	Everything was so salty that it didn’t freeze but all the same, was an unbearably bone aching cold.  	101
2	1	101	3	People massed around the cauldron and galley and each other.  	62
2	1	101	4	Mary and Waylon were an item much to her parents dismay.  	58
2	1	101	5	Still, Judith could tell there was no trouble with the unexpected child.  	74
2	1	101	6	Judith warned him that Mary was young and that a voyage would not be permanent.  	81
2	1	101	7	They cuddled together and she opened the books and taught herself out of one of the Latin books.  	98
2	1	101	8	Waylon helped her guess the correct pronunciations of the words.  	66
2	1	101	9	It was so very easy to pronounce once she got the hang of it but the grammar was more confusing than ever.  	108
2	1	101	10	After one book, another one came out and it was the very special book with the red cross on it.  	97
2	1	101	11	She wouldn’t be able to let Waylon help her with this one.  	60
2	1	101	12	She would read it out of his sight.  	37
2	1	101	13	She just had the feeling that it wouldn’t be a good idea to share everything here.  	84
2	1	101	14	After weeks of reading by day and candle-light, Waylon would take longer to come see her after his daily duties on the ship.  	126
2	1	101	15	Captain Pierce was not happy with this at all fearing to lose his best man.	75
2	1	102	1	One night, Waylon decided to pop the question.  	48
2	1	102	2	Mary stood on the capstan amused that she was now as tall as Waylon. 	69
2	1	102	3	He left her there and looked up to her.	39
2	1	103	1	“I want to be with you after we land Mary Perkins.  	52
2	1	103	2	I love you….I love you more than life itself.”	46
2	1	104	1	“I love you too.”	17
2	1	105	1	“I heard the Captain tell your parents to work on you to leave me.”	67
2	1	106	1	“They haven’t done so yet.”	27
2	1	107	1	“It’s coming Mary.  	20
2	1	107	2	When we land, we’ll have to run away together.  	48
2	1	107	3	Will you do that for me?”	25
2	1	108	1	“Yes Waylon.”	13
2	1	109	1	Captain Pierce had let on that he was working below deck when in reality, he had stayed in his cabin and watched the whole affair secretly.  	141
2	1	109	2	He had a good hunch what was happening.	39
2	1	110	1	Just hours later, the Captain came up to Mary, “Your parents have volunteered you to work in the galley.  	106
2	1	110	2	Come with me.”	14
2	1	111	1	Captain Pierce showed Mary around.  	36
2	1	111	2	The oldest crew member was there.  	35
2	1	111	3	His pants barely held up.  	27
2	1	111	4	They set her to work mixing dough for the bread and taking the bushels of peas and grains out to make gruel.  	110
2	1	111	5	Seeing that the older man was already staring Mary up and down, Captain Pierce put the old man in charge of the watch and taking the whipstaff.  	145
2	1	111	6	Mary began crying.  	20
2	1	111	7	Judith stopped in and comforted her and helped her.  	53
2	1	111	8	“He tied our hands Mary, he’s in charge, he doesn’t want his men distracted.”  	79
2	1	111	9	Mary took these words harder than they sounded.  	49
2	1	111	10	She wept uncontrollably.  	26
2	1	111	11	She thought about what she just told Waylon. 	45
2	1	111	12	Run away with him?  	20
2	1	111	13	I won’t even see him now.  	27
2	1	111	14	Mary was being taught a long lesson.  	38
2	1	111	15	It wasn’t an easy lesson.	25
2	1	112	1	A week passed and Mary and Waylon had figured out a way to meet in secret for a brief moment, sharing a kiss goodnight as they passed each other up and down the ladder.  	170
2	1	112	2	All eyes were on them.  	24
2	1	112	3	The Captain didn’t take long to notice this problem for him either and while he was not cruel to Mary, he was strict and unyielding to her painful look.  	154
2	1	112	4	Captain Pierce considered briefly flogging Waylon but decided against it knowing it might just make Mary long for him even more. 	129
2	1	112	5	Mary grew very resentful of the Captain while still understanding his role as protector of the ship and providing for them.  	125
2	1	112	6	She grew confused and with that confusion, the storm clouds grew.  	67
2	1	112	7	The Captain settled on his last plan.	37
2	1	113	1	One late afternoon, Captain Pierce invited the Throckmortons to dine with him personally.  	91
2	1	113	2	He got Rebecca drunk, lavishing her with the best brandy and acting the prim and proper Captain.  	98
2	1	113	3	He let John escort Rebecca right up to the ladder but made a dire request that the storm was on its way and to go below to grab storm supplies, candles and so on.  	164
2	1	113	4	His men would then distract him by reason of having those supplies buried.  	76
2	1	113	5	Captain then called Waylon over to take Rebecca to the galley saying she needed to get out of the storm while drunk and to try splashing water on her face and taking her back to the cabin below.  	196
2	1	113	6	He whispered to Rebecca that a strong and very capable crew member would help her to her quarters.  	100
2	1	113	7	Captain Pierce knew Rebecca to be easily lured while under the influence and that she was a very beautiful woman but also “taken”.  	132
2	1	113	8	He also knew Waylon’s weaknesses.  	35
2	1	113	9	He had seen him ogle girls enough times to know what he liked. 	63
2	1	113	10	He wouldn’t do any real harm to the Throckmortons but there would be enough trouble to give Mary a shock. 	106
2	1	113	11	The plan worked all too well to the Captain’s great satisfaction. 	66
2	1	113	12	As soon as Waylon and Rebecca were alone, Waylon was holding her up and Rebecca was giggly and the two were having humorously awkward and accidentally intimate moments.  	170
2	1	113	13	The prim and proper Captain cheerfully woke Mary up from her “well-deserved nap” and took her to work in the galley.  	118
2	1	113	14	When the Captain opened the door, Rebecca had lifted a knee and thigh bared to all and Waylon’s shirt was torn further. 	120
2	1	113	15	The Captain acted all shocked and bellowed “Waylon, you’re taking too long in here!  	85
2	1	113	16	Take her back now!”  	21
2	1	113	17	Mary’s face was in shock, tears, anger, more tears. 	52
2	1	113	18	The Captain grinned every so subtly to himself, pleased with his innocent and clever plan to “prevent the disaster” of losing his matey.  	138
2	1	113	19	Waylon stood there ghost white in the face, jaw open and speechless and angry and confused with himself.  	106
2	1	113	20	He blindly took the blame all himself unaware of the ruse. 	59
2	1	113	21	Mary took it extremely hard. 	29
2	1	113	22	So hard in fact that Captain Pierce started to realize the extreme pain he caused a poor fifteen year old girl who he thought all along was going to be too wily for him.  	171
2	1	113	23	The Captain mentally kicked himself and stayed resigned to being angry with himself the rest of the day, not talking to anyone.  	129
2	1	113	24	He could still hear Mary, crying and leaning next to the capstan, all the while, dark clouds gathered, thunder pummeled around the heavens for a moment making Captain Pierce confused that his cargo was shifting below deck.  	224
2	1	113	25	“Go check out that noise Maarten!”	34
2	1	114	1	“Aye aye Captain!	17
2	1	114	2	, Aye aye!”	11
2	1	115	1	“Move!”	7
2	1	116	1	More thunder rolled, the Captain realized the mistake he took with the sound and starting to think back through all the mis-steps he had taken that day.  	154
2	1	116	2	He jinxed himself with that lie about the storm.  	50
2	1	116	3	Each of Mary’s sobs was echoed by the thunder.  	48
2	1	116	4	He saw her face change in its countenance.  	44
2	1	116	5	A teary but angry indignation could be seen in her set jaw and furled brow which framed her heaven-aimed eyes. 	111
2	1	116	6	Fear struck him that he might be in the presence of a heretofore unknown, divine, power in possession of this young lass.  	123
2	1	116	7	Awestruck and inching back he froze hearing the commotion around him of both skies and occupants of his vessel.	111
2	1	117	1	Now John Throckmorton could be heard shouting below as everyone was feeling the push-pull from the waves from the storm, the titan winds at tug-o-war.  	152
2	1	117	2	Lightning flashed and boomed in unison as it struck one of the watery peaks just off the starboard.  	101
2	1	117	3	One at first, then all around.  	32
2	1	117	4	Waves teetered the ship up and down like a broken schoolyard contraption. 	74
2	1	117	5	Waves started to crash in around the rails of the main deck.  	62
2	1	117	6	Yells were heard and whistles blew,	35
2	1	118	1	“All passengers below deck, All hands on deck!”  	49
2	1	118	2	came the echoing voices from the Captain as  he regained composure and took over for Way.	89
2	1	119	1	Mary was comforted and taken by Reverend Williams down the ladder as men waited to climb up the ladder. 	104
2	1	119	2	John had not found the storm supplies. 	39
2	1	119	3	The room under the main deck was shook around and gloomy as a closed coffin except the times lightning struck.  	112
2	1	119	4	Reverend Williams could be heard audibly praying.  	51
2	1	119	5	John clutched his wife Rebecca in his arms along with their servants and young children.  	90
2	1	119	6	The Onge family bowed their heads to the ground, Edmond’s hat coming off and bowing in prayers.  	97
2	1	119	7	Mary was sobbing.  	19
2	1	119	8	To most, it was a passing thought that this might not be a young lady merely scared of a storm but after so many shocks and near misses with lightning, no one was thinking of much else except survival!  	203
2	1	119	9	Ladies grabbed desperately for the spare staple rings used to tie excess fur cargo back to the motherland. 	107
2	1	119	10	Judith had been yelling for Mary the whole time.  	50
2	1	119	11	He voice barely audible above the rocking, creaking, thundering of the cargo below and the thunder in the skies above.  	120
2	1	119	12	Her voice was hoarse from the commotion. 	41
2	1	119	13	Her father John, himself assuming Mary had still been napping was panic stricken when Mary wasn’t found in her bed.	115
2	1	120	1	The Captain soon exhausted himself, resigning himself to ride it out.  	71
2	1	120	2	Several times, his crew had tried to take down a sail and fell back down on the main deck, Waylon among them.  	111
2	1	120	3	In all his years as Captain, nothing like this was ever seen before.  	70
2	1	120	4	In the lightning, he thought he could see images of the people who had haunted his conscience.   	97
2	1	120	5	A light flashed.  	18
2	1	120	6	Mary was there, standing on the capstan with eyes widely furious, another flash, Rebecca was there dazed and stumbling.  	121
2	1	120	7	Another.  	10
2	1	120	8	His wife stood there and she was pointing at him.  	51
2	1	120	9	His guilt became as deep as the waters around him.  	52
2	1	120	10	In his lost frame of mind, a wave of water washed over him, waking him up.  	76
2	1	120	11	He grew dazed but determined again to keep his ship afloat.  	61
2	1	120	12	His hands were numb holding the whipstaff, he spun frantically, avoiding the troughs in the sea, using all the wits he could manage to drive his giant whale through the treacherous waves.  	189
2	1	120	13	He was gliding through it.  	28
2	1	120	14	He felt his faith tested and he was still alive. 	49
2	1	120	15	Still alive.  	14
2	1	120	16	His life would sometimes flash past him again, only to nearly slip and lose his footing on the deck. 	101
2	1	120	17	At one point, he let go of the wheel.  	39
2	1	120	18	“Guide me!  	12
2	1	120	19	I’m sorry!  	12
2	1	120	20	Deliver us Lord!”	17
2	1	121	1	The ship bounced it’s way from peak to peak and after a moment, it was just rain, no lightning and no thunder. 	111
2	1	121	2	Just waves and rain.  	22
2	1	121	3	The waves seemed to tire a little. 	35
2	1	121	4	The passengers noticed this too.  	34
2	1	121	5	After a while, the boat just took on a steady rock. 	52
2	1	121	6	It was windy, rainy and the boat rocked for day after day.  	60
2	1	121	7	People stayed below all night, feeling around for food, huddling together and by day, take dares going above deck.	114
2	1	122	1	For weeks it rained.  	22
2	1	122	2	A good number had caught colds.  	33
2	1	122	3	Mary took to making a remedy for them.  	40
2	1	122	4	With her skills, she was able to bring all of them down from their fevers, chills, and aches. 	94
2	1	122	5	Judith and John were glowing with pride at her successes.  	59
2	1	122	6	Elizabeth made warm wools for them to wear and stay warm in. 	61
2	1	122	7	Everyone started pulling together and helping each other out.  	63
2	1	122	8	Captain Pierce also had become a very soft man to everyone and everyone was using first names including Roger the Reverend.  	125
2	1	122	9	The Reverend called everyone together for prayer. 	50
2	1	122	10	Mary was still feeling like her heart was broken. 	50
2	1	122	11	Waylon tried to look over to her and smile.  	45
2	1	122	12	To no avail, Mary’s heart was lost.	35
2	1	123	1	The rains came back and Waylon climbed the masts again to take the sails down.. 	80
2	1	123	2	Just as he was taking down the last sail, a glint of black poked out of the water out in the distance.  	104
2	1	123	3	His hopes grew, he waited for more of it to show. 	50
2	1	123	4	It grew bigger..and bigger.  	29
2	1	123	5	Sure enough, Land!	18
2	1	124	1	“Land! 	7
2	1	124	2	Land Ahoy! 	11
2	1	124	3	Land Ahoy!”	11
2	1	125	1	The passengers were climbing up the ladders as fast as they could putting on their raincoats and wet wear and going onto the main deck to see.  	144
2	1	125	2	Mary’s heart shivered in trepidation at the dreadful prospects of having to decide her path once she landed. 	109
2	1	125	3	They all beamed at the sight of it, a beautiful mass, each of them pointing it out to each other.  	99
2	1	125	4	They’d lose sight of it from time to time as the rains blew in and the clouds rolled in and the ship started to bounce again.  	127
2	1	125	5	Nonetheless, they stared intently towards the mass as it got bigger and bigger.  	81
2	1	125	6	Despite their joys, some of them stepped back down the ladder.  	64
2	1	125	7	Mary had it in her heart that she might try to make amends with Waylon and started thinking about him again.  	110
2	1	125	8	His manly show of nimbleness and power enduring the harsh rains moved her and stirred passion back within her.  	112
2	1	125	9	He climbed the spritsail yard with daring.  	44
2	1	125	10	The thunder started rolling and crashing in again.  	52
2	1	125	11	Distant rumbles echoed overhead.  	34
2	1	125	12	The ship was tossing over again, causing Rebecca to get sea sick and vomit over the port. 	90
2	1	125	13	Edmond was trying to help with the ropes.  	43
2	1	125	14	Roger was doing his best to catch the lines falling down and coiling up the slack ends.  	89
2	1	125	15	Just as they were able to see the land a dozen or so miles away, the details clear enough to see even through the dark veil of rains,	133
2	1	126	1	Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!	23
2	1	127	1	The Dutchman yelled first “Man Overboard Man Overboard!!” 	58
2	1	127	2	yelling so loudly that he coughed heavily after, his chest still recovering from cold.  	88
2	1	127	3	“Waylon!” 	10
2	1	127	4	screamed Mary.  	16
2	1	127	5	A distant “Help!” 	18
2	1	127	6	could be heard between waves crashing over his head.	52
2	1	128	1	Everyone repeated the call “Man Overboard!”	43
2	1	129	1	Seconds later, Captain Pierce was leaping into action, grabbing ropes, grabbing anything he could find and tossing it over for him to catch.  	142
2	1	129	2	Anything loose that could float was tied to any ropes that were loose.  	72
2	1	129	3	He grabbed the whipstaff and tried to slow the ship so he wouldn’t fall behind.  	81
2	1	129	4	This couldn’t be a worse time.  	32
2	1	129	5	He needed the time to prepare to drop anchor a few miles away from shore so they wouldn’t end up dashing the ship into pieces onto the rocky shore and rocks in the bay, sinking the entire thing.  	196
2	1	129	6	That would be less than half an hour away. 	43
2	1	129	7	For fifteen whole minutes, Captain Pierce, the crew, everyone was watching helplessly as Waylon struggled.  	108
2	1	129	8	Mary continued to bawl until hoarse. 	37
2	1	129	9	Captain Pierce tried to bring one other sail down. 	51
2	1	129	10	The waves eventually became too much, he had already exhausted himself and the boat was going too fast and they soon lost sight of him through the veils of the rain.  	167
2	1	129	11	Way’s head bobbed one last time and never emerged again.	56
2	1	130	1	Swearing could be heard from stern to bow, poop deck to holding deck and starboard to port.  	93
2	1	130	2	Mary had never seen Captain Pierce “cry”.  	43
2	1	130	3	He was red-eyed, red faced, tears rolling, not bawling but grumbling and sobbing incoherently about “his son”, “my son”, “lost my Way”.  	137
2	1	130	4	Mary was sobbing uncontrollably, holding her aching head, pulling down her hat over her face, her collar up to her nose, her face in her hands.  	145
2	1	130	5	She fell to the ground over a pile of un-coiled ropes, her face buried and sobs heard under the roars of thunder and the hiss of rains. 	136
2	1	130	6	The boat was nearing shore and Captain Pierce leaped into action again showing some unusual strength for someone she had only seen give orders and do light work.  	163
2	1	130	7	He climbed the masts, lowered the largest sail, the anchor dropped and the ship dragged for a but until the anchor caught.	122
2	1	131	1	The ship bobbed around in place in the rains and waves by shore the rest of that afternoon.   	94
2	1	131	2	The waves eventually calmed and they set sail gently along the coast, anchor readied to drop again.  	101
2	1	131	3	The rains however continued.	28
3	1	1	1	Mary walked off the gangplank and onto the dock.  	50
3	1	1	2	Loud cheers were heard but Mary’s heart was heavy.	50
3	1	2	1	Every so often, she let out a deep sigh.  	42
3	1	2	2	She thought sleep might push the pain away.  	45
3	1	2	3	Everything had a way of reminding her of Waylon and she fought with herself inside.  	85
3	1	2	4	She lost the desire to live and eat.  	38
3	1	2	5	Did she over-react?  	21
3	1	2	6	The pain was too much and needed the distance but she still couldn’t help but wish she hadn’t.  	96
3	1	2	7	She never got to say a single word to him and he was too embarrassed to  try and explain.  	91
3	1	2	8	Inside she felt turmoil as wide and deep as the storm.  	56
3	1	2	9	It almost felt like I did that.  	33
3	1	2	10	He never got to hear him explain or tell him how she was feeling.  	67
3	1	2	11	It was unfair.  	16
3	1	2	12	She realized something was up with the whole scene the way she remembered it.  	79
3	1	2	13	It just didn’t seem like him.  	31
3	1	2	14	She wanted to forgive him for that reason...Deep down, she knew something fishy was going on and she was duped.  	113
3	1	2	15	It didn’t seem like that had been going on behind or back or anything.  	72
3	1	2	16	Even though she was occupied in the galley, she had peeked out periodically and seen him about his business.  	110
3	1	2	17	There was also her feeling about the Captain.  	47
3	1	2	18	Something just wasn’t right.  	30
3	1	2	19	She somehow knew playing against him she would find herself beaten at anything she tried.  	91
3	1	2	20	She started to feel a little determination.   	46
3	1	2	21	Still, the world was painful. 	30
3	1	2	22	Everything, every fife, whistle, seemed to haunt her.  	55
3	1	2	23	Before she left the ship, she snuck out to see his room, his hammock, his chest. 	81
3	1	2	24	It was much smaller than the big one she had tied down at night and whenever the boat had rocked. 	98
3	1	2	25	Still, seeing that put her in a spin.  	39
3	1	2	26	He would never enter that room again, wear that hat again, play his fife again. 	80
3	1	2	27	Tears streamed down her face while a drum and band played. 	59
3	1	2	28	People left her alone, seeing she couldn’t be helped.  	55
3	1	2	29	The cold ceased to distract her despite winds picking up speed the cold February day.	85
3	1	3	1	“Captain!”	10
3	1	3	2	, shouted a long faced dark haired man with a neckcloth and regal clothing.	75
3	1	4	1	“Governor Winthrop, I was was just looking for you!”	52
3	1	4	2	, spoke Captain Pierce in an unusually formal tone.  	53
3	1	4	3	Judith was a little bewildered at the intensity of the excitement but took it as perhaps the common expression of new arrivals.”	128
3	1	5	1	“I’m giving you two companies of men to help unload the Lyon.”	62
3	1	6	1	Captain Pierce’s face lighted a little.	39
3	1	7	1	John Winthrop continued, “It seems our Deliverance was on the Lord’s own good time.”	84
3	1	8	1	Captain Pierce raised an eyebrow to beckon him continue…he’d share the one loss he endured later.	97
3	1	9	1	“We’ve had an unusually rough winter this year.  	49
3	1	9	2	We have suffered lack of food for weeks.  	42
3	1	9	3	We had rationed down to a mere handful a day to each person of the last of the coarsest meal.  	95
3	1	9	4	I was just handing out the last bit from shaking the bottom of the barrel when I saw a faint dark spec in the fog and then looked up with my glass and spied the Lyon.  	168
3	1	9	5	I thought my eyes were deceived by the illusions of hunger”	59
3	1	10	1	“In truth Sire. 	16
3	1	10	2	We were spared a great storm and though my faith was shaken and sorely tested, all but one of us survived this voyage.  	120
3	1	10	3	My first mate, Way was swallowed by the seas while bravely toiling with the spritsail yard	90
3	1	10	4	.	1
3	1	10	5	 “	2
3	1	11	1	“I am sorely grieved for you.  	31
3	1	11	2	I lost my son Henry to the waters of Salem just last year.”	59
3	1	12	1	Reverend Williams walked over and raised a brow at this conversation.  	71
3	1	12	2	Seeing his arrival, the governor made a welcoming gesture to the Reverend.	74
3	1	13	1	“Greetings in the name of our Lord, Reverend Father!” 	54
3	1	13	2	proclaimed Winthrop in a very proper but less cheerful manner. 	63
3	1	13	3	“Peace be unto you.”	20
3	1	14	1	“And unto you, your Lordship”	29
3	1	15	1	“I now would like to humbly ask your presence and a blessing at a feast which I will soon declare.  	100
3	1	15	2	I will be introducing you to the Indians here by their tribes.  	64
3	1	15	3	We must be giving our thanks for those blessings which in truth we do have which the Lord has seen in his grace to bless us with.”	130
3	1	16	1	“For that, I would like to report that we have a heavy leaden ship with extra provisions due to our swift arrival and our lack of passengers who would not brave the journey this season.  	187
3	1	16	2	All in all, we were truly blessed by compare to some of the most leisurely sailings.  	86
3	1	16	3	It truly is miraculous.  	25
3	1	16	4	I would welcome it.”, replied Captain Pierce, more eloquent than ever heard before.	83
3	1	17	1	“I accept your kind invitation, Governor.”	42
3	1	18	1	Mary admired Winthrop’s courtly manner and dress with his sharp neckcloth reminding her of the Viscount to a degree.  	118
3	1	18	2	She started feeling the piercing cold in her bones.  	53
3	1	18	3	It was marshy and foggy out.  	30
3	1	18	4	She gave a visible shudder.  	29
3	1	18	5	Winthrop noticed this and looked kindly upon her with the look of concern and spoke up. 	88
3	1	18	6	“Mr. 	5
3	1	18	7	Perkins, your children are cold. 	33
3	1	18	8	Please come by and warm yourselves at my fireplace if it be good with them.”	76
3	1	19	1	“We are much obliged.”	22
3	1	20	1	They marched through snow and slush.	36
3	1	21	1	She flipped back to a page she had previously read that made her think of when it might get warm again:	103
3	1	22	1	If Candlemas be fair and bright,	32
3	1	23	1	Come, Winter, have another flight;	34
3	1	24	1	If Candlemas brings clouds and rain,	36
3	1	25	1	Go Winter, and come not again.	30
3	1	26	1	This was a good sign, even if for now it meant great discomfort.  	66
3	1	26	2	The fire at John Winthrop’s home was warm, albeit his house smelled of wet leggings.	84
3	1	27	1	The next day, Mary and Elizabeth volunteered to do some of the housework.  	75
3	1	27	2	It was cold but the land was brightly lit by the sun and it appeared heavily wooded, dark greens, whites and browns speared the white sky with the pine’s evergreen boughs.  	173
3	1	27	3	She could hear winds whistling through the canyons.  	53
3	1	27	4	This new world was a wild and barely inhabited place full of varieties of new trees and bushes, sages and grasses instead of hedges and briars and tall vine laden oaks.   	171
3	1	27	5	The rivers and lakes and rolling hills encompassed them, the sea off in the distance.	85
3	1	28	1	After the fires started to roar under the pots and kettles, people started to arrive bringing all kinds of barrels and crates.  	128
3	1	28	2	She would be helping to prepare the feast that night but was guaranteed a release from duty so as to dress up and attend it.  	126
3	1	28	3	At home, Elizabeth and Mary took out her hat, bodice, skirts and sleeves and all her accessories.  	99
3	1	28	4	Judith, John Senior and Junior noticed Elizabeth had saved her best finery for this occasion.  	95
3	1	28	5	Mary also had a new hat and neckcloth.  	40
3	1	28	6	They were princesses set against the new world’ wild setting.  	63
3	1	28	7	Her younger brothers were dressed like little Lords with their waistcoats, stockings and oiled shoes.  	103
3	1	28	8	Judith had already starting unpacking some of their clothes now that they were no longer roughing it on the long voyage.  	122
3	1	28	9	Elizabeth stared off to sea in a homesick daze.	47
3	1	29	1	As they sat at the table, there were the most unusually dressed newcomers there.  	82
3	1	29	2	Indians with all kinds of apparel on.  	39
3	1	29	3	They had ornate jewelry, feathers, wood, skins and all manner of natural fittings on.  	87
3	1	29	4	They carried skins as coats with them and were browned in complexion like the field labourers at home.  	104
3	1	29	5	Set on the table were large fowl, corn and by the table a barrel of strong waters.  	84
3	1	29	6	John announced that he would be restricting the strong waters except in toasting saying that he did not want our young people to set a poor example to his guests.  	164
3	1	29	7	He introduced everyone at the table and soon everyone was eating.  	67
3	1	29	8	There were many new faces and townsfolk at the table.  	55
3	1	29	9	The people divided somewhat into age groups and genders so as to mingle.  	74
3	1	29	10	Mary and Elizabeth sat together at a table with an Indian girl and another girl who introduced herself as Margaret Jones. 	122
3	1	29	11	Fowl, acorns, salted pork, fresh mutton, clams, beans, lemon juice, extra salt and biscuits sat about the table along with some root vegetables that Mary had never seen before.  	178
3	1	29	12	Everyone looked gaunt and were tearing into the food without a thought for the formality of dinner wares. 	106
3	1	29	13	The Indians looked at the forks and while some ate with them with most properness, a few others were spearing the food and laughing like it might get away.	155
3	1	30	1	The Perkins were soon settled temporarily in Boston.  	54
3	1	30	2	In spring, the rains and wet snows poured heavily over the lands receding their snowlines into the woods leaving pastures and roads green and earthed.  	152
3	1	30	3	Many chores were the same, especially for Elizabeth who learned to spin and weave the new fibres available in the new world like flax and cotton.  	147
3	1	30	4	Mary’s chores varied more in that she spent much more time gathering materials: wood, oysters, berries, flowers, fibers and anything they could use to build up their home.  	173
3	1	30	5	John Sr wanted someone to stake out the land he was granted along the Ipswich River at Jeffrey’s Neck so he sent John Jr. to go up there to stake out the land and guard it and build a simple home there while hunting for meat and skins in preparation for the winter. 	266
3	1	30	6	John Jr loved the idea.	23
3	1	31	1	Mary was out in the fields one day, gathering wild berries based on what her mom Judith had shown her and what her father had discovered from the local Sachem, that is, an Indian chief or the Salvages as some were wont to call them.  	234
3	1	31	2	Mary came across a field of wildflowers and started picking yarrow, sap, and medicinal flowers among the more brutal parts of the landscape. 	141
3	1	31	3	She soon noticed another in the distance, doing the same thing.	63
3	1	32	1	“Mary!  	8
3	1	32	2	Mary!”	6
3	1	32	3	, Margaret yelled from twenty paces.	36
3	1	33	1	“Hallo miss, oh, Margaret, is that you?”	40
3	1	33	2	, Mary was deep in thought over Waylon still.  	47
3	1	33	3	Her mind ached replaying the scene of him helpless in the water and herself reflected unable to help.   	104
3	1	33	4	Margaret gave a curious glance over to them.	44
3	1	34	1	“We met after you landed at the feast, remember?”	49
3	1	35	1	“Yes, I remember.  	19
3	1	35	2	You are Margaret Jones.”	24
3	1	36	1	“Mary Perkins right?”	21
3	1	37	1	“As ever.”	10
3	1	38	1	“Spring brings out some of the most wonderful specimens, do you happy to know where I can find shepherd's purse?”	113
3	1	39	1	“Shepherd’s purse, we’re standing in it!” 	42
3	1	39	2	answered Mary.	14
3	1	40	1	“Oh, well, I have to prepare a remedie of shepherd’s purse and yarrow in preparation against the hemorrhage.  	110
3	1	40	2	I’m going to help my mother with the delivery of a baby in the village.”	72
3	1	41	1	“They both like this dry patch.  	33
3	1	41	2	The yarrow has a scent and gives a numb to the mouth.  	55
3	1	41	3	I’m getting some too.”	22
3	1	42	1	“You sure know your herbs Mary.  	33
3	1	42	2	I’ve had more work with tending to babies and moms.  	53
3	1	42	3	I used to never leave the house.  	34
3	1	42	4	I hope I can be a midwife someday but I would have to learn physician’s arts if I’m going to be good at it. ”	109
3	1	43	1	“Margaret, I’m afraid I know more about cows than babies.  	59
3	1	43	2	My grandfather used to teach me about herbs.  	46
3	1	43	3	He showed me everything that grew in his yard back in England.  	64
3	1	43	4	I do miss it sometimes.”	24
3	1	44	1	“I don’t.  	11
3	1	44	2	Most people who long for the homeland don’t make it.  	54
3	1	44	3	My uncle and my brother both died of scurvy this year.  	56
3	1	44	4	You know the cure for the scurvy don’t you?”	44
3	1	45	1	“Lemons, and yes, we had some on board the ship.  	50
3	1	45	2	My skin would crack and eyes glaze and mouth dry would irritate me to no end.  	79
3	1	45	3	The lemon is sour but it is a Godsend.”, spouted Mary as if teaching at a dameschool.	85
3	1	46	1	“I learned most of my herbs from Thomas Morton.  	49
3	1	46	2	You heard about him right?”	27
3	1	47	1	“No, I haven’t.”	16
3	1	48	1	“Most of what I learned I heard from Thomas Morton.  	53
3	1	48	2	He was a peculiar man from the Old English country.”	52
3	1	49	1	“Cornwall?”	11
3	1	50	1	“Close, Devon.  	16
3	1	50	2	You’re probably saw some of them in Bristol. 	45
3	1	50	3	Their ways are very superstitious. 	35
3	1	50	4	So not long after Thomas Morton planted himself here, he organized a rebellion against Captain Wollaston, exiling him for conducting slave trades using his friends, for the tobacco plantations in Virginia.  	207
3	1	50	5	Morton endeared himself with the peoples and wrote down his studies of this new land and created a new colony of free peoples for savages and men from the motherlands alike, and he revived the old faiths and held revelries around a maypole eighty feet high which he made for them and called it Merrymount.  	307
3	1	50	6	But I think people hate him for other reasons.”	47
3	1	51	1	“Sounds like a merry place. 	28
3	1	51	2	What herbs here did he mention?” 	33
3	1	51	3	said Mary inquisitively, seeing how this could prompt her new friend to give her even more useful information, stories and so on.	129
3	1	52	1	“Tom told me there were a lot of good potherbs for cooked green and that they were more masculine varieties than those in England seeing as they are hardy and strongly formed.  	177
3	1	52	2	He showed me where to find pot-marjoram, good for melancholies and the like. 	77
3	1	52	3	Thymes that grow with needles and many scents, sizes and shapes of their tiny leaves.  	87
3	1	52	4	Anise which is most useful for many complaints of the stomach, the eyes, the nose, coughing...oh but never use with a mother carrying only when she’s giving her milk or for the gas pains when made into a light tea….which I’m sure you know.  	241
3	1	52	5	There are so many herbs here, just like England but these can grow without tending and on the hardest rocks.  	110
3	1	52	6	So many flowers here for the cleansing of the air like violets, lavenders and honeysuckles.  	93
3	1	52	7	We don’t have the wort of St. 	30
3	1	52	8	John that I can tell but it grows easily here and you can find it in Endicott’s gardens.  	90
3	1	52	9	Of course there’s the tobacco, a most miraculous plant great for the bruises but also the relaxation of the mind and soul. ”	124
3	1	53	1	“Why do they hate him so much?”	31
3	1	54	1	”A lot of people don’t like the fact he sells guns to Indians but so do a lot of people... secretly. 	101
3	1	54	2	It’s even in our law. 	22
3	1	54	3	He’s just very obvious about it and makes people worry since he’s not on their side.  	86
3	1	54	4	He’s had a falling out with the governor and court magistrates here.  	70
3	1	54	5	The Indians have mostly used the guns to defend themselves against other tribes that are more bloodthirsty or seeking to rob them.”	131
3	1	55	1	“I don’t think it helps us to get involved either but if we have something...they’ll want us to share it just as they shared everything with us.” retorted Mary sounding a bit wise to herself but simple to Margaret.	214
3	1	56	1	“There’s a lot of evil being said about him but I think he is a good man.  	75
3	1	56	2	He has made a safe home for those whom the very pious amongst us would persecute.  	83
3	1	56	3	They say he consorts with those who can work wonders which can only be done by the devil and with witchcraft and so has fallen into becoming a witch himself. 	158
3	1	56	4	People who knew him in England say he was a good friend of Francis Bacon and a lover of both science, art and wisdom but being particularly good with law.”	155
3	1	57	1	Mary’s thought to herself Why did that name sound so familiar?  	64
3	1	57	2	She heard it several times before and felt a burning of curiosity like she should have already known more about who this was. 	126
3	1	57	3	She gave Margaret pause with her arched brow and took cue to ask: “So when can we find him to meet him?”	104
3	1	58	1	“He was shipped back to England only last year.  	49
3	1	58	2	Only a few years after Tom had set up his garden paradise, he was raided and arrested several times, this last time by John Endecott who also cut down his maypole and took every bit of food they had and sent it home.  	218
3	1	58	3	Tom tried to return there to set it up again but they lay wait for him and arrested him and sent him back to England.  	119
3	1	58	4	It was then they were calling his place Mount Dagon and burned it down.   	74
3	1	58	5	You’ll never guess what I found…..”	35
3	1	59	1	Mary gave a big-eyed look and held up a finger.	47
3	1	60	1	*BOOM!	6
3	1	60	2	*	1
3	1	61	1	In the distance, cannons went off.  	36
3	1	61	2	A celebration was taking place on the ship.  	45
3	1	61	3	They were heavy with weight given they were laden with cannonballs to fight off any dunkirkers.  	97
3	1	61	4	A volley sounded every few seconds.  	37
3	1	61	5	With some of the ships coming up on land, the balls were more a burden than a protection or stabilizing weight.	111
3	1	62	1	Margaret seemed utterly confused..”How did you know…”	53
3	1	63	1	Mary shrugged it off but Margaret was wondering how it might be possible that Mary would know something was going to happen like that.	134
3	1	64	1	“Meet me back here tomorrow?” 	30
3	1	64	2	said Margaret.  	16
3	1	64	3	She took Mary by both hands and smiled gleefully.  	51
3	1	64	4	Mary felt shy but happy to have someone storytell to her while she relaxed out in the warm afternoon light.  	109
3	1	64	5	They both parted the field with bushels of flowers but also headfuls of wonder that evening.	92
3	1	65	1	The next day, Judith was worried that Mary might wander too far and get abducted by raiding tribes.  	101
3	1	65	2	She knew some of the local tribes were friendly but even they warned them of the other tribes who were less friendly to the settlers.  	135
3	1	65	3	John Endicott, the previous governor had provoked a few of them before John Winthrop arrived.  	95
3	1	65	4	Mary explained she would meet Margaret Jones and Judith was very pleased to hear of her.  	90
3	1	65	5	She accompanied her to meet Margaret herself and so Mary introduced them.	73
3	1	66	1	“Mary, I think I know something about you.”	43
3	1	67	1	“Well you probably should know then that I am a princess.”	58
3	1	68	1	“A princess!?”	14
3	1	69	1	“Mom, tell Margaret I’m a princess!”	36
3	1	70	1	“I don’t know what you’re talking about”, glared Judith ever so subtly at Mary but spoken in a nonchalant tone.  	113
3	1	70	2	Mary backed down. 	18
3	1	70	3	Margaret looked confused.  	27
3	1	70	4	Judith cleared the air: “Oh, Mary must be talking about the imaginative games she plays while doing her chores. 	112
3	1	70	5	Helps get them done faster I’m sure.  	38
3	1	70	6	How about you join us for dinner tomorrow?”	43
3	1	71	1	This cut their meeting short after Margaret left, but that night Mary had a talking to, “Mary, any time something marvelous happens, people will, without a second thought, attribute it to God until it disagrees with them, it is then that they immediately ascribe it to the Devil as trickery, even when it does no harm.  	320
3	1	71	2	Watch out that whatever you do is not seen as too fantastic my daughter, people may love you at first but how quickly they can turn from that kind of love.”, said Judith in her wizened tones.  	193
3	1	71	3	“You must always remember that the admiration and attention of others is a very fleeting and ill compensation for the wisdom that comes with holding your tongue and given people ideas they claim as their own but accomplish your designs.  	238
3	1	71	4	Like the sickness of honey, it seems joyful but only for an instant. ”	70
3	1	72	1	Mary wasn’t so sure Judith had ascertained Margaret’s disposition so accurately towards the matter.  	101
3	1	72	2	“Mother, she is very sympathetic to gifts of spirit.”	53
3	1	73	1	“In that case, just to be safe, you must always attribute any perceived miracle that is good to the grace of God, these people will not slight you for it.  	156
3	1	73	2	If something evil come of it, instead blame it on your shortcomings and pridefulness and lack of diligence but do not mention God or blame it on nature and certainly never suggest witchcraft or others will follow that line of folly to a very misunderstood position and end. 	274
3	1	73	3	I want you to read this book I brought with me, The Discoverie of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot”	94
3	1	74	1	“Basically it’s cover for those who are cunning.  	50
3	1	74	2	People often cannot tell what they have witnessed without someone or something to make sense of it to them.  	109
3	1	74	3	You must be ever watchful to play off your gifts with modesty and humility and if possibly, without notice	106
3	1	74	4	.	1
3	1	74	5	 “	2
3	1	75	1	“I think Margaret has already noticed	37
3	1	75	2	.	1
3	1	75	3	“	1
3	1	76	1	“Well then, I will have to inquire of Margaret for myself as to what truly lies in her heart and her trustworthiness for our craft.  	133
3	1	76	2	Perhaps, we can initiate her to be with us.  	45
3	1	76	3	Can she be hired to help us perhaps?”	37
3	1	77	1	“She’s already very busy working to be a midwife.”	50
3	1	78	1	“I can offer her better than what she has now.  	48
3	1	78	2	Let’s talk to her tomorrow”	27
3	1	79	1	Mary and Judith left Elizabeth with her spinning and Elizabeth was soon off on a date with a fine suave yet somewhat older gentleman, William Sargent, who rode his coach by there.   	182
3	1	79	2	It had almost seemed since arriving that Elizabeth’s fortunes for a future husband had changed.  	97
3	1	79	3	Judith would not stand in the way.  	36
3	1	79	4	Judith did however take the boys with her.	42
3	1	80	1	Margaret greeted her: “Good wife Perkins, if I may speak so boldly, I know Mary is a very talented girl.”, spoke Margaret.  	124
3	1	80	2	“She has gifts of seership it would seem.  	43
3	1	80	3	I know this might alarm you that I know this but do not be afraid that I would speak ill of any of you.”	104
3	1	81	1	Judith took Margaret aside and it seem she gave her some tests using two wooden sticks and a crude box.  	105
3	1	81	2	Something Mary had never seen before.  	39
3	1	81	3	Every test was different, no girl could possibly cheat.  	57
3	1	81	4	Judith thought of starting up the Dameschool for which John Perkins Sr. had been very keen to.  	96
3	1	81	5	She could get students and help and she merely had to pay for some food and space.	82
3	1	82	1	They went home to dinner discussing everything Judith was planning for a school...a Dame School but one where they could share the arts with each other as well as study the old great works, Latin and so on so midwifery and the arts of physick would be understood for their craft.	279
3	1	83	1	Mary and Margaret were allowed to go out together on foraging walks together.  	79
3	1	83	2	Margaret had successfully performed the services of a midwife and Mary was excited to find out about it but instead of being able to listen to Margaret, Margaret asked Mary a few questions this time.	199
3	1	84	1	“Mary, do you know Reverend Williams?”	38
3	1	85	1	“Yes Margaret, I do.”	21
3	1	86	1	“What do you think of him?”	27
3	1	87	1	“He’s a kind but very serious man and betimes quick to taking offenses.  	73
3	1	87	2	He’s very wise and intelligent.  	33
3	1	87	3	He can already speak the tongue of the Narragansett like one of their own and has become well respected by them.  	114
3	1	87	4	He’s not very fond of the English church and would be first to separate us completely from them.  	98
3	1	87	5	He’s just and fair minded and it seems he’s a better diplomat to the natives than his own people much like Thomas but much less exciting other than when he’s on one of his contemptuous moments	192
3	1	87	6	.	1
3	1	87	7	 “	2
3	1	88	1	“Margaret, tell me more about Tom.  	36
3	1	88	2	Why did the people hate him so?”	32
3	1	89	1	“Some people say Tom was in conspiracy with Sir Gorges to claim the land.  	75
3	1	89	2	Others say he was laying with their women in wicked frivolities.  	66
3	1	89	3	The tales people spread...I don’t believe them until I see them.  	66
3	1	89	4	So many wonders here have people in a daze at times.  	54
3	1	89	5	Their vigilance at the wildness of this place causes them to worry and see things that aren't’ there. 	102
3	1	89	6	I don’t care if it’s true or not.  	35
3	1	89	7	He wasn’t my suitor or anything. ”	34
3	1	90	1	“Margaret, teach me how you would deliver a baby?”	50
3	1	91	1	“The first thing you must mind is that you do not pull too hard on the baby.  	78
3	1	91	2	You must tell the mother to push.  	35
3	1	91	3	You can only pull gently to move out of the way when something is stuck.”	73
3	1	92	1	“Ok, so is that all?”	21
3	1	93	1	“No, there’s much more to it.  	31
3	1	93	2	More that you should not do than what you should do.  	54
3	1	93	3	You must have clean hands and smile at all times. 	50
3	1	93	4	You must watch out for too much blood.  	40
3	1	93	5	You should not baptise the babe yourself.  	43
3	1	93	6	The babe may be chilled.  	26
3	1	93	7	You must give word to the deacon and write it in their book. 	61
3	1	93	8	You cannot bear a false claim of fatherhood to them.  	54
3	1	93	9	You cannot perform sorcery or use means against people because they wish ill or are known not to pay because they are poor.  	125
3	1	93	10	But do not forget that you have a witness who can attest to your labors for her and take your dues that way if they are found to have coins but do not pay.  	157
3	1	93	11	Really, you should not let any man touch the baby...”	53
3	1	94	1	“Why is that?”	14
3	1	95	1	“Bad luck. 	11
3	1	95	2	A baby starts life with the feminine qualities and must remain in a feminine environment until it grows and becomes aware of its being of mankind or of womankind.”	163
3	1	96	1	Margaret had found a new cat who followed her around.  	55
3	1	96	2	It was male cat and Margaret would not give the cat’s name saying he was her familiar.  	88
3	1	96	3	Mary wondered what that meant.  	32
3	1	96	4	Margaret and Mary were finished milking one day and took to shade.  	68
3	1	96	5	As they slept, Mary woke up to a suckling noice.   	51
3	1	96	6	She looked over and there was Margaret’s cat nursing on her dry nipple!  	73
3	1	96	7	That’s really odd! 	19
3	1	96	8	thought Mary.  	15
3	1	96	9	Margaret seemed like such a weird one sometimes. 	49
3	1	96	10	Luckily, the men had left the homestead to do other things and such a scene would not be accidentally find its way into their view!	131
3	1	97	1	Elizabeth suddenly walked in on the two of them sleeping.  	59
3	1	97	2	Elizabeth didn’t even seem to notice but called to them “Finish your chores!”.  	80
3	1	97	3	After they had finished their chores, they went to eat their lunch, Judith announced she would teach them some letters and a special lesson.	140
3	1	98	1	Inside the home, Judith had read some books together with them. 	64
3	1	98	2	Going over the stories from the classics. 	42
3	1	98	3	After, Judith got up and announced that she’d teach them a spell.  	67
3	1	98	4	This spell, she warned, would potentially cause harm but which would, if done in a moment of stress, work instantly and effectively.  	134
3	1	98	5	She instructed them with these words: "Jam Mitius Ardet"	56
3	1	99	1	“When you see the redness of heat in your mind’s eye over the thing you wish to feel it...it will start to heat.  	114
3	1	99	2	Imagine the sun above and the constellation of Virgo and then repeat it again switching focus back to the thing you wish to heat.  	131
3	1	99	3	If you are ready for fire, say this: Non Extinguetur”	53
3	1	100	1	“Do not practice it now...I don’t want anything to burn here.”	62
3	1	101	1	Mary and Margaret went out to the sun to pick flowers as it approached midsummer.  	83
3	1	101	2	They walked past a small haystack and Mary and Margaret looked at each other as if sharing the same idea.  	107
3	1	101	3	They would put it to the test. 	31
3	1	101	4	Margaret tried first incanting three times and switching her mind back and forth as she was taught during the incantation. 	123
3	1	101	5	She said the second phrase feeling confident it would work but stumbled on her words, fearful.  	96
3	1	101	6	Mary interrupted her.  	23
3	1	101	7	“Margaret, let’s do this together, it will be more effective this way.”	71
3	1	102	1	“Mary, I was already feeling it.  	34
3	1	102	2	I didn’t say the second part yet!”	34
3	1	103	1	“Oh, I’m sorry Margaret.”	25
3	1	104	1	“It’s ok Mary, but you do have a point here. 	45
3	1	104	2	Let’s start again together.”	28
3	1	105	1	In unison, they spoke the incantations and just as the second phrase of “Non-exting” was being uttered, the flames took the haystack and there it burned nearly in an instant.  	176
3	1	105	2	Panicking they stopped   They had to now run and tell someone.  	64
3	1	105	3	Dare they tell Mother / Good wife Perkins?  	44
3	1	105	4	They yelled out and Judith saw and smelled almost as quickly as they could start their utterance.  	99
3	1	105	5	She looked at them as if to start to yell at them but instead pushed both hands to the sky, uttered something so quickly they could not comprehend it.  	152
3	1	105	6	It was a rattle of speech so fast as to almost sound like a woodpecker’s knock and suddenly, lightning came down and thunder, and rain came down dousing the flames.	164
3	1	106	1	Judith looked exasperated and wide eyed.  	42
3	1	106	2	“That was excellent but can you practice on something a bit smaller like a candle next time?”  	95
3	1	106	3	Catching her breathe she seemed almost angry on inhale and smiling on exhale.  	79
3	1	106	4	She was unreadable and fiery looking herself.  	47
3	1	106	5	“Oh, and one more thing, you will of all certainty replace this haystack which was going to rot anyway.” and with that she smirked in satisfaction yet much to the chagrin of Margaret and Mary.	192
3	1	107	1	After Judith had let into them.  	33
3	1	107	2	Mary reflected a bit.  	23
3	1	107	3	She seemed kind yet stern enough about it but something in her voice was even more serious, scared even.  	106
3	1	107	4	There was something dangerous beyond the fire and Mary couldn’t put her finger on it.  	87
3	1	107	5	Mary thought to talk to Margaret about it.	42
3	1	108	1	“I can understand Mother being so distraught but something’s bothering me about that expression of fear...it wasn’t the fire, that was under control...it was amazing what just happened there but she looked like that part was nothing at all!”	241
3	1	109	1	“Mary, I think I know what is bothering her.  	46
3	1	109	2	She’s worried for our safety...not from the fire.  	51
3	1	109	3	From people.”	13
3	1	110	1	Mary was so glad Margaret could see these blind spots.  	56
3	1	110	2	She was starting to catch on but urged her to speak further.	60
3	1	111	1	“One thing you may not know, is that where we come from, this kind of thing is very bad. 	89
3	1	111	2	It’s against the law.  	23
3	1	111	3	They say it’s against God.  	28
3	1	111	4	To them, to have this much power must be from the Devil and they call it witchcraft.  	86
3	1	111	5	Judith probably shouldn’t have done that.  	43
3	1	111	6	She did it to save our homes. to save us.  	43
3	1	111	7	She took a great risk. 	23
3	1	111	8	She made a call and did what she felt she had to do.  	54
3	1	111	9	If someone saw that, they would surely talk.”	45
3	1	112	1	“So what if people talk Margaret?”	34
3	1	113	1	“You might not have read about it.  	36
3	1	113	2	I’m surprised you haven’t heard more about it.  	48
3	1	113	3	Maybe Judith has sheltered you from such fears out of concern for your advancement and self-protection.  	105
3	1	113	4	We walk a thin post here.  	27
3	1	113	5	If you don’t already know, I don’t know if I’m supposed to tell you this.  ”	76
3	1	114	1	Mary was intensely curious and bade her to continue on.	55
3	1	115	1	“Not long ago, people had to practice a lot of arts to survive but also risked death if they did not practice and they might face death if they did.”	149
3	1	116	1	Mary could hear the trepidations in her vagueness, “Get to the point!”	70
3	1	117	1	“Mary, if you are caught practicing witchcraft and they think you are doing evil, if you speak anything of the devil, if they so much as dislike you and have any of the even slightest suspicion that you are using witchcraft, they will either burn you, torture you or hang you or do anything to kill you and to them, this would not be wrong. 	341
3	1	117	2	It represents the greatest evil in this world.  	48
3	1	117	3	The very Satan they fear against God.  	39
3	1	117	4	It is not always talked about in church but I remember my grandmother telling me how her best friend was burned alive for threatening their livestock with disease and wishing them evil.  	187
3	1	117	5	They said she had the evil eye.  	33
3	1	117	6	They took her to a post in the ground, tied her to it, laid firewood at her feet and light the fire, roasting her alive.  	122
3	1	117	7	Fire is the most painful death you can imagine and with her, the went slowly, using hot irons from another fire at first.  	123
3	1	117	8	When she gasped quiet from screaming too loudly at the pain, they lit the fire sending her whole body up in flame.  	116
3	1	117	9	For a few moments more she was able to force out a huge amount of cursing and screams that would echo across the city with the hoarseness in her voice increasing with the loudness.  	182
3	1	117	10	The pain in her face was too much for some of them to watch.  	62
3	1	117	11	Some fainted before she fell unconscious.  	43
3	1	117	12	Others cheered with Glory to Our God Who Is Just! 	50
3	1	117	13	Glory to him who punishes witches and soothsayers and whores and murderers!  	77
3	1	117	14	Some would laugh and watch as the flesh fell and singed off her frame watching her body become some hideous mass.  	115
3	1	117	15	The blackness of the scorched skull and remaining flesh to them was the image of the demon they wanted to destroy and so they congratulated themselves sometimes for killing a woman who gave children apples and pies but was laughed at and mocked because of how toil and kindness and age wore on her face.  	305
3	1	117	16	With tears in her eyes, she uttered the Lord’s Prayer and the final Peace: ‘Forgive them Father for they know not what they do.  	129
3	1	117	17	Of course, the pious do not want to be nagged by the guilt of such words and dismiss it as easily as a dog’s bark at the moon.  	128
3	1	117	18	Girls like us are at risk.  	28
3	1	117	19	Your mother is at a great risk.  	33
3	1	117	20	She showed great love for you today. 	37
3	1	117	21	She risked her life to help you. 	33
3	1	117	22	We have to stick together and stay loyal to each other and firm in our doing the right thing but also to do it in secrecy.  	124
3	1	117	23	It is tempting to return evil for evil but that often leads down the road of quickly being caught.  	100
3	1	117	24	It is best to be modest and conservative with the use of our magic except for the times we absolutely must use it dear sister.	126
3	1	118	1	Tears were streaming down Margaret’s face.  	44
3	1	118	2	The shock, horror, sadness made Mary’s eyes well up with hers.  	64
3	1	118	3	With a downtrodden feeling of helpless, they gazed at each other a moment.  	76
3	1	118	4	Margaret continued on but slowly this time. 	44
3	1	118	5	“Mary, promise me you won’t tempt me to do this kind of thing again.  	70
3	1	118	6	Let us learn how but not use...Use only enough so we can be sure for when the time comes.  	91
3	1	118	7	Let us instruct our fellow man and womankind to not be so cruel, to be reasonable with each other.  	100
3	1	118	8	We can’t forget our art once we have learned it.  	50
3	1	118	9	We simply have to remember wisdom, silence and loyalty. 	56
3	1	118	10	Pray to all the gods and goddesses, their parents, their ancestors down to the Ancestor of all Gods, the Eternal God and Eternal Goddess who are the Eternal One for help.  	172
3	1	118	11	I would tell you more but I would not want to give you contrary to what your mother told you.  	95
3	1	118	12	My mother gave me the same instruction before she died.  	57
3	1	118	13	You and your mother and sisters I would suppose are the only others I know who are Matrons of Life and Death, and Mistresses of the Great Work other than the one or two I told you earlier. 	189
3	1	118	14	Those wise men who are here to carry the words of the art when it cannot be handed to a woman. 	95
3	1	118	15	However, they lack what we can do just as we lack some of what they can do. 	76
3	1	118	16	One is not better than the other. 	34
3	1	118	17	I hope you understand now. 	27
3	1	118	18	I’ve said what I had to.”	25
3	1	119	1	“Yes Margaret, I understand everything you’ve said and more.  	62
3	1	119	2	Let’s go play!”	15
3	1	120	1	The next day, Judith’s lesson changed a bit. 	45
3	1	120	2	“While power is limited only by the imagination, there are several wonders that are considered dangerous follies.  	115
3	1	120	3	First, coercing love.  	23
3	1	120	4	Love cannot be constructed only nurtured when it’s already there.  	67
3	1	120	5	Coercing love goes against the foundation of Love which can only grow from one’s Will which depends on their level of consciousness.  	134
3	1	120	6	Next, prophesying death.  	26
3	1	120	7	Those who know the times of their death die on the spot because they will cease to live any more and do all in their power to hedge up against the inevitable day. ”	164
3	2	1	1	John Jr was sitting up dressed in the lightest garments he owned in the hut he had built all by himself on “Perkins Island” one morning.  	138
3	2	1	2	The nights were short and sultry and he had awoken early in a sweat by the first dawn light.  	94
3	2	1	3	He thought to himself how indecent he might look were he to be back home wearing so few clothes.  	98
3	2	1	4	An Indian man of the Agawam stirred his hut outside.  	54
3	2	1	5	“Master John!” 	15
3	2	1	6	came a yell.  	14
3	2	1	7	Startled, John Jr peeked out and saw a friendly and familiar looking Indian man looking very nervous looking over his shoulder.  	129
3	2	1	8	He went to the entrance.	24
3	2	2	1	“Robin Good Fellow! 	20
3	2	2	2	Come in.”	9
3	2	3	1	He entered and was given a seat and offered some pork to eat by John’s gesture of handing it to him.	100
3	2	4	1	“John, There is danger to tell you.  	37
3	2	4	2	Thursday morning they will come.”	33
3	2	5	1	“Who Robin?”	12
3	2	6	1	“Thursday, four savage invite you go down hill to water. 	57
3	2	6	2	Morning savage come here. 	26
3	2	6	3	They ask take you to good fishing and trade you good bargain.  	63
3	2	6	4	John not go. 	13
3	2	6	5	Not go!”	8
3	2	7	1	“Why Robin?”	12
3	2	8	1	“You and your many man go, they kill you. 	42
3	2	8	2	Kill your many man. 	20
3	2	8	3	They Tarratine tribe.  	23
3	2	8	4	Days before, many many savage attack Sagamore Masconomet camp. 	63
3	2	8	5	Thursday they hide hill.  	26
3	2	8	6	They have forty birch canoe. 	29
3	2	8	7	Many man. 	10
3	2	8	8	They know your many man go. 	28
3	2	8	9	They know your man not home. 	29
3	2	8	10	They say easy kill your man. 	29
3	2	8	11	Your many not many many like them”	34
3	2	9	1	John sat there listening to him asking him to say it again so he knew what Robin was saying and what the attack would be.	121
3	2	10	1	“Robin, come with me. 	22
3	2	10	2	We go see my big sagamore. 	27
3	2	10	3	Sagamore sagamore. 	19
3	2	10	4	I owe you”	10
3	2	11	1	John lead Robin off the island and onto a trail.  	50
3	2	11	2	He was very glad that Governor Winthrop was close by.  	55
3	2	11	3	Governor Winthrop had spent much of his days directing and working himself to build the village of Ipswich.	107
3	2	12	1	“Governor, I must speak with you now!”	38
3	2	13	1	John felt the fear in Robin’s voice but he knew he would have to act bravely and judiciously to fend off this attempt at destroying the tiny village along with his only home.	174
3	2	14	1	“What is it John Perkins?”	26
3	2	15	1	“The Tarratine tribe to the north is going to try and raid our village by deceit.  	83
3	2	15	2	This is Indian Robin.”	22
3	2	16	1	Robin stood there silent for a moment, John prompted him to greet. 	67
3	2	16	2	After a warm greeting by Governor Winthrop, he motioned that they sit down to talk.  	85
3	2	16	3	John relayed the Tarratine plan to lure them into a trap by having unarmed Indians offer them trade at the waterfront which would be  surrounded by warriors laying in wait inside birch canoes docked out of view by the shore.	224
3	2	17	1	They came up with a plan.  	27
3	2	17	2	Governor Winthrop took off for Salem to rally the men there to aid the fledgling colony at Ipswich.	99
3	2	18	1	Thursday morning, sure enough, the Indians came to offer trade saying they had many goods on the shore and wished to trade for very meager amounts of corn.   	158
3	2	18	2	John Jr. outwitted them feigning his interest and asking them about the quantities they had with a slight air of greed, widening his eyes at their words and acknowledging their offers with a subtle grin which bait they took and eagerly responded to going on with even more straight faced tempting offers and expressing an air of confidence in their plotting. 	359
3	2	18	3	Deep in John’s mind, he knew it worked to his advantage.  	58
3	2	18	4	He could see the spot they were taking him to that it was where he suspected it.  	82
3	2	18	5	The governor’s men were already there.  	40
3	2	18	6	John broadened his step walking them close enough to his own ambush which they were satisfied enough to travel along side him wherewith. 	137
3	2	18	7	Everything Robin said had been true to the letter in John’s mind and just as he suspected.  	92
3	2	18	8	He walked a little towards the brow of the hill where he knew they’d be hiding and the trading Indians told him the supplies were not that way, thus detecting right where they had laid the trap.  	196
3	2	18	9	John then took them towards his own ambush again which they were pleased with thinking he was being easily compliant.  	119
3	2	18	10	Governor Winthrop had instructed John to bring them close but backs to him.  	77
3	2	18	11	John stopped the Indians paces short of the bottom of the hill and snarled: “If you don’t leave now, we will shoot you.”	120
3	2	19	1	Realizing their plot had been discovered, they snarled back at him and mumbled angrily with each other in their own tongue. 	124
3	2	19	2	John knew they might try anyway since they still thought the Englishmen outnumbered and so bring back their warriors thinking perhaps he was bluffing in desperation. 	166
3	2	19	3	Just as they had turned their backs, the governor’s men fired muskets from the marshes and beat a drum to imply a combined force of Englishmen and Agawam also in hiding there.  	177
3	2	19	4	Now thinking this was no bluff but a counter-ambush, they now ran top speed in utter fright at being surrounded themselves. 	124
3	2	19	5	After they had disappeared around the hill, John saw forty birch canoes jump out from behind that hill and shove off out to sea making away as fast as they their paddles could paddle them. 	189
3	2	19	6	The entire troop of warriors had been successfully outwitted by a new hero in Ipswich, John Perkins Jr.	103
3	2	20	1	The next day, a meeting was called. 	36
3	2	20	2	Reverend Cobbet had heard the whole chain of events and John discovered that Governor Winthrop had been successful in rallying support and godly compassion for the fledgling colony in peril at Ipswich. 	202
3	2	20	3	People lifted their voices in praise up to heaven for their deliverance of Salem and Ipswich that day.	102
3	2	21	1	Governor Winthrop announced: “For bravery, sharp wit and diligent service to the people of Ipswich and Salem, I hereby commission John Perkins Jr, Quartermaster of the company guard in Ipswich on this very day. …”	213
3	2	22	1	John Perkins Jr was overwhelmed with honor bestowed to him and his family by extension but remembered to defer praise in modesty to the Lord and count himself naught but performing according to the necessities at hand by the grace of God.	238
3	2	23	1	“Furthermore, I hereby appoint him and give him charge over the first public house in Ipswich for his keen understanding and skill at trade and careful book-keeping.”	166
3	2	24	1	John Perkins Jr. would retain that title of Quartermaster from that day forward unto his last.  	96
3	2	24	2	On most of the public documents seen in Ipswich at that time, one can read in his own pen styled as “I, John Perkins Quartermaster and ordinary keeper.”.  	155
3	2	24	3	Even as ordinary as he made himself appear, he was always counted as one of the leading men of their village.   	112
3	2	24	4	The news soon made itself back to Boston where the whole family thanked the heavens, Father and Mother for their son's deliverance and made offerings and wrote their remembrance adding it to their Book of Memories to their ancestors in the motherland.	251
3	2	25	1	October leaves were turning bright orange as Judith sat in her chair beholding their first scene of New World fall.  	117
3	2	25	2	Elizabeth was cleaning bundles of flax with an intimidating new flax brush transforming it into shiny fibres  which could have easily been mistaken for cuttings of her own blonde hair.  	186
3	2	25	3	Judith’s appetite had taken a turn away from the pickled pork and instead turned to the pickled cucumbers she had taken a liking to aboard the Lyon.  	150
3	2	25	4	She had also finished a good portion of a bowl that had nothing but honey and butter in it.  	93
3	2	25	5	Her tummy felt a new tightness and tingly warmth that she was already well familiar with.  	91
3	2	25	6	Mary was working with the butter minding her own until she heard Jacob ask, “What’s troubling you mother?”	106
3	2	26	1	Judith answered him with a question that held everyone’s attention for a good few seconds: “Would you like a sister or a brother Jacob?”	136
3	2	27	1	John Sr.’s eyes lit and jaw dropped held up by smiling and blushing cheeks with the look of joyous surprise.  	110
3	2	27	2	“Are you certain my dearest?  	30
3	2	27	3	Let me get the step.  	22
3	2	27	4	We are going to try the Powah test.”	36
3	2	28	1	John brought out a small stepping block made of leftover wood from their makeshift home.  	90
3	2	28	2	“Step up”.  	12
3	2	28	3	Mary took a step up on the block.  	35
3	2	28	4	John nodded his head with everyone waiting for his response.  	62
3	2	28	5	He teased their anticipations further.  	40
3	2	28	6	Judith queried, “Then would it be a girl?”  	44
3	2	28	7	John diverted her attention and asked Elizabeth, “Would you hand me a good thread of flax daughter?”  	102
3	2	28	8	Elizabeth quietly picked and cut a thread she was working on twisting.  	72
3	2	28	9	He took Judith’s ring and tied the ring on the flaxen cord and dangled it.  	76
3	2	28	10	It swung around and around.  	29
3	2	28	11	“From the foot she chose and the movement of the ring and the honey lacking in her dish, I would say she will be a, a, “, he paused in teasing for which Judith and all the children’s voices pleaded “John! 	205
3	2	28	12	Father! 	8
3	2	28	13	Papa!” 	7
3	2	28	14	together.	9
3	2	29	1	“A Girl!”	9
3	2	30	1	Mary and Elizabeth exchanged a look and then at John Jr and finally to the two lads.  	86
3	2	30	2	Mary held Jacob’s hand, “You’re going to have a little sister!  	64
3	2	30	3	Won’t that be exciting?”  	26
3	2	30	4	Jacob didn’t look as pleased as she had expected.  	51
3	2	30	5	Thomas was happier at the prospect.  	37
3	2	30	6	Their expressions gave dad and John Jr. a chuckle.	50
3	2	31	1	Mary offered to Judith, “I will help you mother.”.  	52
3	2	31	2	Elizabeth chimed in a “I, as well.” and Judith lovingly smiled back at them.  	78
3	2	31	3	Judith got out of her chair slowly as if almost to start playing the weakened lady but then started a brisk walk to the door.  	127
3	2	31	4	She returned, “I will surely let you know and again as I need it.  	67
3	2	31	5	I will ask Margaret to help me as well.  	41
3	2	31	6	I will ask her to come board with us.”	38
3	2	32	1	Margaret came by and started situating the house. 	50
3	2	32	2	Industriously, they went deep into their daily chores, seeing them as an art instead of just a drudgery.  	106
3	2	32	3	“Every drudgery is an opportunity for invention and cunning.”, Judith would remind them.   	91
3	2	32	4	Mary taught Margaret the arts of enfleurage and salve making.  	63
3	2	32	5	Thomas and Jacob were becoming strong young men and were very able at tending the livestock as John Sr prepared them for a new home in Ipswich.  	145
3	2	32	6	Mary still milked the cows and took the chicken eggs and cooked food and churned butter as Elizabeth continued to comb, spin and weave flaxen sheets and do the laundry for Judith’s upcoming delivery.	199
3	2	33	1	The day of deliverance finally came for Judith.  	49
3	2	33	2	On the moon of Gemini at the start of June, Judith went into labour.  	70
3	2	33	3	The men were outside, not allowed in.  	39
3	2	33	4	Every birth was a new ordeal to Judith.  	41
3	2	33	5	She was unaccustomed to a delivery on this new land, new town of Boston had few doctors to boast of.  	102
3	2	33	6	The ones they did have were very novice.  	42
3	2	33	7	Judith was grateful to have a trained midwife like Margaret there by her side.  	80
3	2	33	8	Through some touch of magic, Judith’s ordeal was very easy and short with Margaret’s gentle coaching of mom and coaxing of the baby.  	134
3	2	33	9	Mary was there with Elizabeth to help.  	40
3	2	33	10	Margaret insisted on using flax which could be boiled clean and dried in the sun to catch the precious child saying that it would ensure mother did not catch illness from the bad airs found in the shade.  	205
3	2	33	11	Mary contributed skullcap and catnip and sunlight flower tinctures along with cramp bark. 	90
3	2	33	12	Margaret helped massage and position Judith during her labor pains.  	69
3	2	33	13	Mary also kept blood staunch of yarrow in case of bleeding and Motherwort on hand in case the false early labor cramps.	119
3	2	34	1	Margaret noticed Judith going into a full body labor meaning it would be soon.  	80
3	2	34	2	She helped by humming a tune which would help time the push every few minutes.	78
3	2	35	1	Margaret had already coached Mary that when mom is starting to tire or feel and end coming to the automatic pushing to encourage pushing to help finish the labor, giving reassuring pauses with each hum of the right spot in the tune.  	234
3	2	35	2	Judith’s water broke and right after, the little baby girl had slipped on out.  	80
3	2	35	3	Margaret and Mary worked together to develop a salve that would naturally relax Judith for the baby’s exit with little resistance. 	131
3	2	35	4	Mary and Elizabeth teamed up to help work on the cord and swaddle the baby and check the baby’s sex with Margaret’s instruction.   	131
3	2	35	5	After a few seconds of being handled, the baby let out a big wailing non-stop cry.  	84
3	2	35	6	Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhaaaghhaggh!  	35
3	2	35	7	Waah!	5
3	2	35	8	, Weaahh!	9
3	2	36	1	“It’s a healthy baby girl!” 	28
3	2	36	2	announced Elizabeth as she handed the swaddled child to Judith to hold and settle down with.	92
3	2	37	1	“Awwww”	7
3	2	38	1	“Ohhhh”	7
3	2	39	1	The girls all gathered around adoring the tiny baby who looked up at each of them with big deep eyes.	101
3	2	40	1	“You are a Godsend Margaret.” sighed Judith in relief, sweating heavily wet and exhausted.  	92
3	2	40	2	Mary had prepared a boiling pot and a cool water pot to pat the heat away and a fresh spring water jug and a cup for Judith to drink.	133
3	2	41	1	John Sr. was nervously pacing as was almost always the case with a father-once-again. 	86
3	2	41	2	Mary was sent to tell father the good news. 	44
3	2	41	3	His face lit with joy and gratitude for their excellent work.	61
3	2	42	1	Mary and Margaret embraced each other a last time for the time to come.	71
3	2	43	1	“I love you Mary.” sobbed Margaret as she held her close.	57
3	2	44	1	“And I you Margaret.”, answered Mary not totally grasping the depth of feeling Margaret was having.  	101
3	2	44	2	Margaret in fact shuddered with emotions.	41
3	2	45	1	Margaret kissed Mary on the cheek tenderly.  	45
3	2	45	2	“My friend always	17
3	2	45	3	.	1
3	2	45	4	”,	2
3	2	46	1	“Always Margaret.”	18
3	2	47	1	“Do not forget to write me or else!”	36
3	2	47	2	, sobbed Margaret sternly at Mary holding a pointed finger softly on her shoulder.	82
3	2	48	1	Mary strode off, turning her head as she walked behind Judith and Lydia carted in a small wagon pulled by their small team, lead slowly by her father and brother, Thomas and Jacob held onto her hands.  	202
3	2	48	2	Elizabeth strolled on her own ahead.  	38
3	2	48	3	Whenever Mary turned around, there was Margaret waving a handkerchief, the blush from her tears still visible from a distance.	126
3	2	49	1	The wind picked up greatly as the moved along the trail.  	58
3	2	49	2	Mary could hear her baby sister suckling away.	46
3	2	50	1	The next month, Mary received post that Margaret safely went back to Charleston.	80
3	2	51	1	Someday, I will tell you what this does.  	42
3	2	51	2	I fear that day may be cut short.	33
3	2	52	1	From what I can tell, you will outlive every sibling and your first child.	74
3	2	53	1	One of your children will force you to learn a new kind of compassion.	70
3	2	54	1	Keep it with you.  	19
3	2	54	2	It may be that my soul would tell you from the dust of the grave.	65
4	1	1	1	Baby Lydia had just gone to sleep Judith’s arms as she sat in her favorite chair.	81
4	1	2	1	She grew fast in the space of a few moons.  	44
4	1	2	2	The construction John Sr had done with the help of his friends and family there in Ipswich had been miraculously quick.  	121
4	1	2	3	John wanted to give Lydia the best home he could.  	51
4	1	2	4	The winter was fortunately mild.  	34
4	1	2	5	The family furniture had grown and was still piled up from the move.	68
4	1	3	1	“Mary,” Judith called her in a familiar tone for something not unpleasant.	74
4	1	4	1	“Going swiftly Mother!”	23
4	1	4	2	, replied Mary.	15
4	1	5	1	“You were right you know.”	26
4	1	6	1	“Oh?”	5
4	1	6	2	, she feigned a little surprise although she inwardly knew what mother might say.  	83
4	1	6	3	She was waiting to hear it and she had a hunch this was the time.	65
4	1	7	1	“Yes, about Lydia, about arriving here.  	41
4	1	7	2	I should be more careful when I answer your questions.  	56
4	1	7	3	But at the least, we are all here safe and sound.”	50
4	1	8	1	Weeks passed and the teenagers were getting bored of their chores despite how demanding they were and decided to go to the meeting house construction site.  	157
4	1	8	2	Elizabeth and Mary came across two girls and a boy who they watched playing tossing a bundled rag across a field of just reaped.  	130
4	1	8	3	Elizabeth got nervous approaching them and Mary feels shy too.  	64
4	1	8	4	They finally walked up.	23
4	1	9	1	“Can we be of service to you?” 	31
4	1	9	2	offered Elizabeth in an unusually stilted manner.  	51
4	1	9	3	Elizabeth never felt comfortable these days.  	46
4	1	9	4	She had moved around so much it was hard to keep making new friends.	68
4	1	10	1	“Who are you and what is your purpose here?” 	45
4	1	10	2	replied a girl ignoring the offer of service.	45
4	1	11	1	“My name is Elizabeth Perkins and this is Mary also of Perkins.”	64
4	1	12	1	“Oh, I’ve heard about Perkins before!  	39
4	1	12	2	Is your brother the Quarter master and keeper?”	47
4	1	13	1	“Why yes that, he is.” replied Elizabeth.	41
4	1	14	1	“I am Joanne and this is my brother James.” said the girl.	58
4	1	15	1	“Am not!” 	10
4	1	15	2	replied James with an eye roll.	31
4	1	16	1	“It’s just a game.  	20
4	1	16	2	My father is William Sargent, So do you want to play with us?” 	63
4	1	16	3	replied Joanne..	16
4	1	17	1	“Sure but we don’t want trouble ok and you must not speak too much of this. 	76
4	1	17	2	We have chores to do.” replied Elizabeth	40
4	1	18	1	“I know a better place we can play, How about the center of the green? 	71
4	1	18	2	I’ll bring my batting stick and we can play a quick game of ball.”, chimed James.	81
4	1	19	1	They walk towards the middle of the green but find there’s people already there.	80
4	1	20	1	“Hey George, come help me out here!” 	37
4	1	20	2	said a man in the distance.  	29
4	1	20	3	George was a brawny man in all his measures very large with a soft beard, strawberry blonde hair and brown muscles poking out of his clean white sleeves.  	155
4	1	20	4	Elizabeth stared at him in girlish awe.  	41
4	1	20	5	Joanne and James were also staring him down.  	46
4	1	20	6	They could hear another man whistling in the distance as he carried planks of wood.  	85
4	1	20	7	They look back over realizing they had an audience.  	53
4	1	20	8	Elizabeth looked around at everyone.  	38
4	1	20	9	“We really can’t just sit here staring;” glad she was now looking busy by talking, “let’s try and dance to that tune he’s whistling, that should amuse them!”	157
4	1	21	1	Mary thought this might be an opportune time to try her hand at a love spell.  	79
4	1	21	2	Keeping the visual from her book in mind, imagining it vividly, the heart, the flame, the thorns, animating it in her mind, she uttered the words softly, the Latin syllables whispered sounding unusually odd.  	209
4	1	21	3	Elizabeth didn’t seem to even notice except that maybe Mary was just being odd.  	81
4	1	21	4	She closed both eyes, opened one eye looking forward at George and winked as she repeated it three times with exacting pronunciation and mustering the feelings in her heart just as she had learned.	197
4	1	22	1	Elizabeth was still making eyes at George as the held hands skipping in a circular motion, turning her head and keeping her gaze on him, checking on him. 	154
4	1	22	2	Mary saw George look right at her and he smiled back.  	55
4	1	22	3	Mary was taken by a bit of surprise and wondered at her own efficacy of her love charm.  	89
4	1	22	4	Just seconds later, the echoes of cheers came to their ears.  	62
4	1	22	5	Mary looked at herself in her mind’s eye, feeling small, young and vulnerable compared to her older sister and friends.  	121
4	1	22	6	Elizabeth notices George is not looking at her but someone else, wondering if it’s Mary or Joanne. 	99
4	1	22	7	When she realizes it’s Mary, she feigns getting tired and slows them down to a stop.  	86
4	1	22	8	“Whew!”	7
4	1	23	1	The claps and cheers could be heard from afar.  	48
4	1	23	2	Hooting and hollering and whistlings forming a cacophonous ring in her ears.	76
4	1	24	1	Joanne looks at Mary, “My stars Mary, it looks like the men really took to you!”	80
4	1	25	1	“Maybe it’s because I had to skip higher than the rest to keep up with you!” 	77
4	1	25	2	exclaimed Mary, now feeling the exhaustion settling in and her wind leaving her.	80
4	1	26	1	“He’s got to be at least 36 or 37 Mary, you’re only 18!  	57
4	1	26	2	Why would he waste his time checking out someone half his age?!  	65
4	1	26	3	I’m the one who Mom wants to start dating.  	44
4	1	26	4	Besides, I saw him first and we have more in common.” protested Elizabeth, looking like her spirit had just been drained.	121
4	1	27	1	“Elizabeth…” started Mary.	26
4	1	28	1	“No, let’s not talk about this, we should be getting home by now, the sun is almost settling on the hills.” countered Elizabeth.	128
4	1	29	1	Mary and Elizabeth ran home as fast as they could. 	51
4	1	29	2	They saw Judith standing at the door, tapping a wooden spoon against her palm and glowering at them.  	102
4	1	29	3	Thoughts rushed through Mary’s mind wondering if mother had the omniscience to know what they were just up to that day.  	121
4	1	29	4	Play was discouraged in favor of work during these busy times.  	64
4	1	29	5	The only play should be work related play...that was plenty of play for her.  	78
4	1	29	6	She forgot the obvious.	23
4	1	30	1	“I was worried sick about you two.  	36
4	1	30	2	You’re home much later than usual and I’ve been taking care of your brothers and the baby this whole time.  	108
4	1	30	3	I hope you brought me clean baby cleaning cloths!” 	51
4	1	30	4	she syncopated in between baby bawlings.	40
4	1	31	1	Both Mary and Elizabeth hung their heads in shame admitting guilt. 	67
4	1	31	2	There was no getting past this and they knew how it would go. 	62
4	1	31	3	There would be no talking back, just head wagging to all their disappointment and a sudden rush of getting to business in rectification and restitution of their negligence.  	174
4	1	31	4	Behind their heads, Judith unfurled her brow in both relief at their return and relief of taking on the sole duties.  	118
4	1	31	5	Elizabeth grabbed baby Lydia smelling the immediate concern Judith had with the clear implication that she’d manage the mess there.  	133
4	1	31	6	Mary took Jacob and Thomas to where Elizabeth was changing Lydia away from Judith who slid out to the kitchen to finish a supper she had started on.  	150
4	1	31	7	Judith took comfort in tending the fire despite the heat.  	59
4	1	31	8	Alone at last she could lose herself in the bubbling waters in her pot.  	73
4	1	31	9	Elizabeth gave Mary another sour look which Mary ignored.  	59
4	1	31	10	Mary looked concerned since Elizabeth held her baby sister in her arms all the while slamming rags into the bucket. 	116
4	1	31	11	Taking a hint, she handed Lydia to Mary as she started working on the mess on the floor she had made in her haste create by her mood.  	135
4	1	31	12	Why would Elizabeth blame it all on her? 	41
4	1	31	13	It was her suggestion to play with them.  	42
4	1	31	14	She was reminded of this look some time in the past when she was first a-courting with Waylon.  	96
4	1	31	15	Just then, a large bump bump thud was heard.  	46
4	1	31	16	Elizabeth had slipped while turning around twisting her ankle.	62
4	1	32	1	“Owwwwwwww!”	12
4	1	33	1	“Liza, what happened? 	22
4	1	33	2	Are you ok?”	12
4	1	34	1	Elizabeth hobbled off on one foot to Judith.  	46
4	1	34	2	Elizabeth cast Mary a look, not of blame this time but self-frustration but also unwillingness to take her assistance.  	120
4	1	34	3	Mary felt sorry for her but also hurt that she’d not let her help her out this time.	84
4	1	35	1	After another hour of rocking Lydia in her arms, it grew quieter.  	67
4	1	35	2	Her mind wandered to babies of her own, who her husband might be one day. 	74
4	1	35	3	Mary gleamed a bit thinking about the possibility of new romance.  	67
4	1	35	4	Somehow, the pain she felt with Waylon faded and was now replaced with a new kind of pain she knew had to be the guilt for having new feelings and not being loyal to her old ones.  	181
4	1	35	5	Was it enough time?  	21
4	1	35	6	While she knew the folly of hanging onto death forever, she could still not help the feeling of the growing guilt inside her and the longing to replace it all with potential new love.  	185
4	1	35	7	A fog and blindness of obsession set in her heart, sending it thumping in anticipation of these new possibilities.  	116
4	1	35	8	Am I in love?   	16
4	1	35	9	Mary knew she wouldn’t have picked George out of a line up of suitors but the situation of competing with Elizabeth, putting her back in a place of sorts made this compelling. 	176
4	1	35	10	A filthy but tempting mix of infatuation, satisfaction and longing to love again filled her heart with a craziness that seemed to feel like love all over again.  	162
4	1	35	11	The excitement was there.  	27
4	1	35	12	He was a fine gentleman. 	25
4	1	35	13	His age seemed to have been compensated by his charm.	53
4	1	36	1	This whole time, Mary was oblivious going through her chores with the flurry of thoughts speeding through her mind like a busy crossroad.  	139
4	1	36	2	Lydia was going to sleep in her arms and she gave her fresh milk from the morning’s milking. 	93
4	1	36	3	She didn’t notice the babbling noises of talking place in the other corner of the house between Elizabeth and Judith.  	119
4	1	36	4	The boys were occupied with setting up the table with dinner wares as Judith had trained them to do.	100
4	1	37	1	Elizabeth switched out of a whisper and into a merely low tone as she told Judith, “I do think Mary has a new suitor. 	118
4	1	37	2	We’re so sorry but she was interrupted and tried as best as she could to break away back home…”	95
4	1	38	1	“This is all too soon. 	23
4	1	38	2	We just got here, how can we do anything to mind this matter or prepare for her courtship if we barely know the people who have moved here.”	140
4	1	39	1	“John knows a lot of them.”	27
4	1	40	1	“Still, we have barely become acquainted with any of them and I’m telling you now.  	84
4	1	40	2	Mary’s still too young and it’s still too soon since she lost her last young gentleman suitor.  	96
4	1	40	3	These things never go well when done in such haste.  	53
4	1	40	4	Can we not slow down enough to get our own matters taken care of before we run off in every which direction we can?”	116
4	1	41	1	“We’ve been through alot and we have tired ourselves out. 	58
4	1	41	2	No rest or merriment at all for our souls?  	44
4	1	41	3	Our heart will not last through the amount of work if we keep heading into it without reprieve.  	97
4	1	41	4	We’ll be languishing through our lives without fulfilling the measures thereof, glorifying no one.” replied Elizabeth, feeling a bit at odds with herself seeing how this might help Mary to her own detriment.  	209
4	1	41	5	Stil, her own heartache was starting to wear on her.	52
4	1	42	1	“What do you suggest then?”	27
4	1	43	1	“What about we meet in the green for the next feast and we bring a portion of food for everyone using your most delicate arts in bakings.”	138
4	1	44	1	“There’s a pleasant thought for the soul. 	42
4	1	44	2	Let’s go ahead then and let our neighbors know that we will attend the next feast.” replied Judith, “...as long as you help with everything else this week.”	156
4	1	45	1	That took a little cheer out of Elizabeth’s face but she then quipped, “Perchance then we will find someone who can help us out here so we can attend to the needs of our spirits in worship and care for others.” with her usual persuasively encouraging tone.	256
4	1	46	1	“I want you to also keep an eye out for Mary and not go fooling around with silly suitors of your own.  	104
4	1	46	2	Both of you need to train your hearts to making things improve in our home here.  	82
4	1	46	3	I will not suffer another day of idle sporting with the gentry here at the cost of our younger children and your father’s care.” replied Judith.	144
4	1	47	1	Dressed in their best finery, the Perkins enter the space filled with tables and benches and a canopy made from old sails. 	123
4	1	47	2	Elizabeth lead them in the front with a limp and chooses an empty spot right in front of the man they called George. 	117
4	1	47	3	Judith looks dismayed wondering if this is the gentry she had envisioned in her mind’s eye that gave Elizabeth and Mary so much rivalry the past few days.  	156
4	1	47	4	George doesn’t pay any mind to Elizabeth, bowing his head as if in prayers over food about to be served.  	106
4	1	47	5	At least he’s a devout man thought Judith. 	43
4	1	47	6	But an old lanky Scotsman from the looks of it. 	48
4	1	47	7	Elizabeth cleared her throat a few times. 	42
4	1	47	8	A few seconds later George looks up and stands up looking apologetically hurried at having not stood for the entry of ladies.	125
4	1	48	1	“Greetings good ladies and gentlemen just arriving. 	52
4	1	48	2	Sir, “ nodding to John Sr., “Madame, “ nodding to Judith. 	58
4	1	48	3	He was apparently senior in that group but without a wife.	58
4	1	49	1	“How do you do Sir, I don’t believe we’ve had the good grace of meeting yet.” offered John Sr, “May I introduce you to my family.”	130
4	1	50	1	“My pleasure good sir. 	23
4	1	50	2	If I may go first, I am Mister George Carr. 	44
4	1	50	3	Please just call me George.”	28
4	1	51	1	John was taken back a bit but realized he was just being welcoming since they were the newcomers and John Sr. was not used to having to make second introduction.	161
4	1	52	1	“I’m Sargent John Perkins and this is Good Wife Perkins. 	57
4	1	52	2	My eldest son could not join us due to his calling and duties but may join us some other day, the Lord willing.  	113
4	1	52	3	Here is my darling daughter Miss Elizabeth, Miss Mary, Master Thomas, Master Jacob and our newest blessing, Lydia.”. 	117
4	1	52	4	With that John Sr. went to help his wife and daughters into their chosen seats.	79
4	1	53	1	Elizabeth took to quickly smiling in her subtle way at George coupled with a stare that betrayed her shyness. 	110
4	1	53	2	Elizabeth didn’t want to let her feelings of disappointment get in the way of her attempts at charming him so in frustration, she just sat still trying to show her prettiest features.  	185
4	1	53	3	None of this got George’s attention. 	37
4	1	53	4	But instead, he looked over again at Mary.  	44
4	1	53	5	Prayers of thanks and food soon arrived.	40
4	1	54	1	John Sr breaks the ice, “So George, I hear you are the local shipwright in town, was I right in hearing that?”	110
4	1	55	1	George puts down his fork and responds, “That’s right, I have built a boarding dock and have the rivers hauling for me day and night	132
4	1	55	2	.	1
4	1	55	3	  … it’s a good stable line of work for me.”	44
4	1	56	1	“That sounds good George, maybe we can work out a deal on some trades.”	71
4	1	57	1	“I’d be happy to, I need more able bodied men.”	47
4	1	58	1	“I’m afraid I can’t help you there, we’re looking for help ourselves.”	70
4	1	59	1	“Well, we can come to some arrangement later, I have way too many shipments waiting on shore. 	94
4	1	59	2	I have lots of flour, ale, cloth and shoes that someone dropped off and I haven’t heard from them since.” replied George, Elizabeth’s eyes opened.  	148
4	1	59	3	Mary cleared her throat., “Mister Perkins, I could have sworn I saw your daughter Miss Mary here not long ago somewhere. 	121
4	1	59	4	Are you sure we haven’t met before?”	36
4	1	60	1	“I don’t have a memory of it.” replied John Sr. 	48
4	1	60	2	With that, they continued to eat a while.	41
4	1	61	1	“In any case, I’m about ready to hand it off to the savages unless I can get a pound or two for it. 	100
4	1	61	2	Do you know anyone who would be able to pick it up?”	52
4	1	62	1	Mary beamed a smile at dad who picked up the idea, “I can look at the cloth goods and pick some out to bring home.”, the thought of the adventure and prestige gave Mary a bit of a thrill but it also nagged her how Elizabeth felt.	229
4	1	63	1	“At least let me pack her a good lunch for her travel and labors.  	67
4	1	63	2	She’ll go back before sun starts to shade again.” said George sounding very mature and grandfatherly almost.  	110
4	1	63	3	George was older than Mary by about 15 years but younger than John Sr about that many years.  	94
4	1	63	4	George had a very wrinkled face but a full head of hair while John Sr had greys above his ears and peeking through his stubbled face.	133
4	1	64	1	“Aye George. 	13
4	1	64	2	I can send her tomorrow if you so need it”	42
4	1	65	1	“Aye Sir, it would please me to help us both but as you so wish.”	65
4	1	66	1	“It will be tomorrow then.  	28
4	1	66	2	Mary, you’ve got chores tonight.”	33
4	1	67	1	Mary nodded.	12
4	1	68	1	At home, Elizabeth was fretting, angry and upset again. 	56
4	1	68	2	This time she was in tears. 	28
4	1	68	3	Mary came up to her looking at her in the eyes.  	49
4	1	68	4	“I don’t want him to break your heart sister.  	47
4	1	68	5	I will make haste with my business there for you.”	50
4	1	69	1	“No Mary, I apologize to you.  	31
4	1	69	2	I have wronged you and it must be my lot to continue in my loneliness.  	72
4	1	69	3	I cannot take away your joy if that is how he chooses.  	56
4	1	69	4	It was not meant to be if he does not return my favor in kind.  	64
4	1	69	5	Take no such cares for what I am doing, be happy and carefree.  	64
4	1	69	6	I will find a suitor some day and make dates with him.  	56
4	1	69	7	I should be lucky to have even one as it seems.”	48
4	1	70	1	“Lizzie, I can’t.”	18
4	1	71	1	“For me Mary, do not make me feel guilt for holding back your happiness.  	74
4	1	71	2	The devil is one who wants others miserable as himself.  	57
4	1	71	3	I will endure what the Lord sees fit to try me with.  	54
4	1	71	4	I just thank the Lord each day he has not lead me into temptation.  	68
4	1	71	5	I shouldn’t cease it, the Lord will bless according to the will of the Father.”	79
4	1	72	1	“Enough of the Sunday prophesying for me Lizzie but you what is in your heart and spirit and you will be blessed in patients and due time.  	140
4	1	72	2	Some people are much happier when these come about later than sooner in life. 	78
4	1	72	3	Either way, I will keep my heart with yours as I travel to and fro there and will not burden your soul. 	104
4	1	72	4	I will pray for guidance.”	26
4	1	73	1	“Thank you Mary.”	17
4	1	74	1	Elizabeth grabbed Mary and hugged her tight.	44
4	1	75	1	The cock crowed and the sun shone in the windows casting long streams of light onto the bare floor.  	101
4	1	75	2	Mary thought a rug would be so much nicer there. 	49
4	1	75	3	She walked to the cart by the barn and took each handle on it and walked up the road in a plain but clean white apron and frock. 	129
4	1	75	4	Her hair was put into a bonnet.  	33
4	1	75	5	As she goes past the green, the memory of when she first laid eyes on George came into her mind.  	98
4	1	75	6	She felt a sudden fright, awkwardness, cold and numb legs, her body was shaking so slightly from these new thoughts.  	118
4	1	75	7	There was thrill and dread rolled into one.  	45
4	1	75	8	She walks up to the door and knocked between the iron hinges.  	63
4	1	75	9	Everything about this place was sturdy like a ship but smaller. 	64
4	1	75	10	It might have been like a cabin plucked right out of a vessel.	62
4	1	76	1	There was no answer.  	22
4	1	76	2	She could hear wooden boards clacking together behind the path along the side.  	80
4	1	76	3	George was there stacking boards.  	35
4	1	76	4	When he turned his head and saw Mary, he let the boards fall and tumble out of his hands. 	90
4	1	76	5	“Lo..”  	8
4	1	76	6	He seemed a bit shocked.	24
4	1	77	1	Mary gave him a little grin, “Have I arrived too early ...?”	60
4	1	78	1	“George”, he broke in.	22
4	1	79	1	“George”, she continued, knowing already how he was to be addressed.	68
4	1	80	1	“No, not early Mary.”	21
4	1	81	1	He sat there in thought for a second. 	38
4	1	81	2	“Let me get you the chest of cloth I have and start packing you up.”	68
4	1	82	1	She watched as George hauled out a chest and then proceeded to empty bags of flour into a bigger crate and then nail it all together. 	134
4	1	82	2	“It’s all yours for one shilling.”	34
4	1	83	1	Her cart was half full but at least she wouldn’t return empty handed.  	71
4	1	83	2	He looked into her face and then smiled.  	42
4	1	83	3	She could see his teeth were stained.  	39
4	1	83	4	She was put off by it a bit.  	30
4	1	83	5	At least he wasn’t spitting and chewing. 	41
4	1	83	6	It was typical tea.  	21
4	1	83	7	He apparently worked very hard.	31
4	1	84	1	“I got these for you.”, George hands her a bunch of wildflowers.	64
4	1	85	1	“Oh they’re so pretty!  	24
4	1	85	2	No one’s gotten me flowers before!  	36
4	1	85	3	I could cry.”, her eyes welled up, she felt a sudden surge of emotion. 	71
4	1	85	4	Relief that he was a sensitive and hardworking man and clearly had more on his mind than business.  	100
4	1	85	5	She was overcome with worries again.  	38
4	1	85	6	I didn’t really plan on this.  	31
4	1	85	7	He seemed to be all business at the table.  	44
4	1	85	8	She looked at the flowers again and his face.  	47
4	1	85	9	There was something strong and handsome about him.  	52
4	1	85	10	He was on the old side but he had a wonderful build like a very protective type.  	82
4	1	85	11	He came in closer to her.  	27
4	1	85	12	He spent a minute looking at her in the eyes but did not move in for a kiss.  	78
4	1	85	13	Instead he put his hand around her.  	37
4	1	85	14	Held her tight for a second. 	29
4	1	85	15	He closed his eyes. 	20
4	1	85	16	It was an embrace that was both strong and romantic.  	54
4	1	85	17	She held her breath.  	22
4	1	85	18	She could feel his sweat, smell his musk on him. 	49
4	1	85	19	She worked a  hand out and he started to release his hold.	58
4	1	86	1	“I am sorry. 	13
4	1	86	2	I forgot. 	10
4	1	86	3	I must smell like the ditch water from a drained pond out here.  	65
4	1	86	4	Let me change.”	15
4	1	87	1	He moved away just out of view.  	33
4	1	87	2	Pulled off his shirt and looked to see if she was looking back. 	64
4	1	87	3	She was caught off guard staring.  	35
4	1	87	4	She blushed and pulled her gaze back to the ground in front of her.  	69
4	1	87	5	He moved further out of sight, taking his time looking for a new shirt. 	72
4	1	87	6	As he turned around, she could see his tanned arms and very fair skin. 	71
4	1	87	7	His chest was thick, pink nippled and covered in a tawny blonde fuzz with red sheen in the light. 	98
4	1	87	8	He wiped his chest showing his big arms and seemed almost to show off and pretend she couldn’t see him.  	105
4	1	87	9	He was definitely an unusual creature she had never seen the likes of before.  	79
4	1	87	10	He was curious and alluring as a male all at once. 	51
4	1	87	11	Her mind started undressing him further..  	43
4	1	87	12	She was feeling the heat of the day bearing down all around her.  	66
4	1	87	13	She felt a dry mouth and sweat in her hands.   	47
4	1	87	14	She stopped herself and noticed he had found a shirt, and started to look up.  	79
4	1	87	15	She glanced away barely this time. 	35
4	1	87	16	She could see out of the corner of her eye that he was watching her back checking her manners. 	95
4	1	87	17	He stretched into his shirt, the sleeves holding onto his thick arms and he forced them through. 	97
4	1	87	18	He came out cordially smiling.	30
4	1	88	1	“Well, let’s have some lunch then and have a chat.”, he motioned her with his finger to follow him.  	101
4	1	88	2	She walked sheepishly into his home. 	37
4	1	88	3	She had remembered loving before and being so comfortable around Waylon.  	74
4	1	88	4	George made her a little nervous and thrilled at the same time.  	65
4	1	88	5	She felt happy again. 	22
4	1	88	6	For the first time in a long time, she felt some semblance of joy since being with Waylon  It was a new place she assured herself.  	132
4	1	88	7	He was also very intimidating in build.  	41
4	1	88	8	He motioned her to sit.  	25
4	1	88	9	He went to grab some food and a candle for light and lit it.	60
4	1	89	1	“Tell me what the world has been like for you.”	47
4	1	90	1	“I have been milking the cows, tending the garden, tending the baby, I don’t get to do much with spinning or weaving. 	118
4	1	90	2	I clean a lot.  	16
4	1	90	3	Father says I’m the best at cleaning.”	38
4	1	91	1	“That is so remarkable.”	24
4	1	92	1	“How is this remarkable?”	25
4	1	93	1	“I mean, you’re so open and free with your words.  	51
4	1	93	2	I am simply, well, a simple man. 	33
4	1	93	3	A worker. 	10
4	1	93	4	I hope to be independant.  	27
4	1	93	5	You seem very independant.  	28
4	1	93	6	That’s good.”	13
4	1	94	1	“Oh, that’s what you meant. 	28
4	1	94	2	I don’t know what to say really.”	33
4	1	95	1	“You’re a very pretty girl Mary. 	33
4	1	95	2	How old are you?”	17
4	1	96	1	“I reckon around seventeen.”	28
4	1	97	1	“That’s perfect.  	18
4	1	97	2	I mean that’s the perfect age to become independant.”	53
4	1	98	1	Mary couldn’t respond.  	24
4	1	98	2	It was awkward still.  	23
4	1	98	3	She couldn’t figure out what he was going to say next.  	56
4	1	98	4	They ate a lunch of potherbs, ale and then he poured her wine.  	64
4	1	98	5	He poured more wine.	20
4	1	99	1	He finally spoke up again with a slight hiccup. 	48
4	1	99	2	“I hope I will see you again soon.  	36
4	1	99	3	Please?”	8
4	1	100	1	She saw his vulnerable side.  	30
4	1	100	2	She wasn’t drinking as fast as he was.  	40
4	1	100	3	She felt in control enough to respond with a kind assurance. 	61
4	1	100	4	“Sure I will George.  	22
4	1	100	5	I do plan on living here for a good while.”, She tried to improve on that. 	75
4	1	100	6	“I would be happy to see you again.”	36
4	1	101	1	He sobered up a bit. 	21
4	1	101	2	“When?”	7
4	1	102	1	“Not tomorrow but how about Sunday? 	36
4	1	102	2	We can go to church together. 	30
4	1	102	3	And have dinner.”	17
4	1	103	1	He seemed innocent enough. 	27
4	1	103	2	A real romantic.  	18
4	1	103	3	While he stumbled, he picked up her flowers, took her to the cart.  	68
4	1	103	4	She noticed it was a bit more past the time she had wished to leave. 	69
4	1	103	5	He bowed, blew a kiss, waved her off.  	39
4	1	103	6	She trudged back wishing it hadn’t ended so soon.  	51
4	1	103	7	At least there was someone now she could talk to, be with.  	60
4	1	103	8	She might be able to work her mother into letting her go out if she knew he was interested and perhaps courting her.	116
4	1	104	1	She arrived home.  	19
4	1	104	2	Elizabeth hobbled over and hugged Mary. 	40
4	1	104	3	She was still busy with weaving. 	33
4	1	104	4	Mary looked at Elizabeth with a smile to assure her things were all well.  	75
4	1	104	5	Mary wasn’t sure what to tell mom yet.  	40
4	1	104	6	For all they knew, it was just business. 	41
4	1	104	7	Judith went outside and opened the boxes. 	42
4	1	104	8	She looked into the bags of flour.  	36
4	1	104	9	Inside there were some weevil carcases and just a few bits of flour mixed in.  	79
4	1	104	10	Judith wasn’t sure what to say to Mary but she was already starting to read between the lines.  	96
4	1	104	11	She opened the chest hoping to see bolts of woven cloth.  	58
4	1	104	12	There was one bolt of cloth but there were also women’s clothes.  	66
4	1	104	13	His mother’s perhaps?   	24
4	1	104	14	These clothes were much more fashionable and small like for a frail thin woman. 	80
4	1	104	15	They looked fairly new.   	26
4	1	104	16	Perhaps George thought they could resell these or use these for something else.  	81
4	1	104	17	They looked costly enough to be a good bargain but she wondered how she could have mistook the thought of there being fabric for clothing.  	140
4	1	104	18	How did they both fail to inspect the bags of flour? 	53
4	1	104	19	Young people.	13
4	1	105	1	Mary was still inside chatting with Elizabeth, trying to be honest. 	68
4	1	105	2	Mary was indeed happy, thrilled, not sure if she was in love but so happy as to swoon and sigh all the same so Elizabeth would stop pressing her.	145
4	1	106	1	“You are in love...don’t try to hide it Mary Perkins, or should I say the future Mary Perkins Carr.”	100
4	1	107	1	That threw Mary for a loop.  	29
4	1	107	2	that sounded so peculiar even though it had easy enough speech to it. 	70
4	1	107	3	It was just so unexpected.	26
4	1	108	1	The next day, Joanne came over with James for an hour and then returned. 	73
4	1	108	2	Joanne told Mary, “He’s saying he has a new girlfriend.  	57
4	1	108	3	I overheard it one the way over.”	33
4	1	109	1	“You can’t be serious.”	23
4	1	110	1	“He wants the whole world to know you’re his now.”	50
4	1	111	1	“That was very quick of him.”	29
4	1	112	1	“Not a very experienced suitor.  	33
4	1	112	2	But then again, these are changing times and a changing world. 	63
4	1	112	3	Who is to say how is too quick.  	33
4	1	112	4	I see many girls marrying quick so they can have lots of babies to care for things.”	84
4	1	113	1	Mary felt her pulse and breathing pick up.  	44
4	1	113	2	Her nerves were just too high.  	32
4	1	113	3	Was she worried that George might end up like all the others?  	63
4	1	113	4	Play along for now.  	21
4	1	113	5	I want to see where this goes.  	32
4	1	113	6	I’m not anxious to look.  	26
4	1	113	7	Oh what have I gotten into?  	29
4	1	113	8	It’s not on my time.  	22
4	1	113	9	Maybe I can help slow this down, assure mother this will be ok.  	65
4	1	113	10	Mary was quiet the rest of the night.  	39
4	1	113	11	Her thoughts kept her up at night.  	36
4	1	113	12	She couldn’t sleep but eventually found herself waking up, bags under her eyes.	79
4	1	114	1	As Sunday arrived, Mary was ready.  	36
4	1	114	2	She had inquired about the church.  	36
4	1	114	3	It was just barely built. 	26
4	1	114	4	This time she’d be in her Sunday best. 	39
4	1	114	5	Modest, clean, respectable.  	29
4	1	114	6	Mary felt cautious.  	21
4	1	114	7	Wasn’t going to make that same mistake again.   	48
4	1	114	8	George arrived just as it started as Mary waited there.	55
4	1	115	1	George took her softly by the hand. 	36
4	1	115	2	Mary couldn’t help but blush but went along with it.  	54
4	1	115	3	She knew by this time, the cat had to come out of the bag and what a cat it was. 	81
4	1	115	4	Whispers were heard and at that point, Mary knew she would stick by him.  	74
4	1	115	5	There were other men sitting together, glancing and wondering if they had the courage to approach Mary and fend off George.  	125
4	1	115	6	For once, Mary felt like a proper part of the community at large.  	67
4	1	115	7	She looked radiant and was grabbing all the eyes.  	51
4	1	115	8	George look solid and firm and stoic there.  	45
4	1	115	9	He was as charming as ever chatting with his friends, the hired hands who had worked for him before.  	102
4	1	115	10	As was proper, George introduced Mary to the reverend.  	56
4	1	115	11	Her mind was so overwhelmed she had no way of keeping a name there.  	69
4	1	115	12	They opened with various prayers, slight echoes were heard.  	61
4	1	115	13	It was the one thing the churches had in common was that no matter how small, they all seemed to carry an echo.  	113
4	1	115	14	All the congregational churches looked roughly the same but the readings and prophesying varied a lot between too soft to hear and overwhelmingly loud.	151
4	1	116	1	During the reading, George started to sit closer and then put his arm around her holding her in tight.  	104
4	1	116	2	His warmth felt cozy, he took control and turned to smile at her.  	67
4	1	116	3	She smiled back and would go back to listening and blending in.  	65
4	1	116	4	Every once in awhile, she thought she saw George looking at a few of the other girls even younger than herself. 	112
4	1	116	5	After a while, he squeezed her and put his arm back down in his lap.  	70
4	1	116	6	Mary had a hard time understanding the reading, it sounded Latin but unfamiliar and fast.  	91
4	1	116	7	She thought the song sounded like something out of the Poor Clares, a group of nuns who sang as far as she knew.  	114
4	1	116	8	After this soft song, a very loud speaker rose up.	50
4	1	117	1	“What will you do for God? 	27
4	1	117	2	That is the question I have often asked myself. 	48
4	1	117	3	What are you willing to give up? 	33
4	1	117	4	The problem I see today is that too many do not remember that in Israel, when Moses lead them to the land of promise, they lusted and forgot sacrifices. 	153
4	1	117	5	Should we let that happen to us?	32
4	1	118	1	“Nooooo / no / noo	18
4	1	118	2	.	1
4	1	118	3	 “	2
4	1	119	1	“We have been lead to a new land of promise, not my Moses but by God directly. 	79
4	1	119	2	Will we forget what happened? 	30
4	1	119	3	What happens when we forget to sacrifice? 	42
4	1	119	4	God is God. 	12
4	1	119	5	He will require of it from us anyway. 	38
4	1	119	6	He is free to torment us to teach us to get back. 	50
4	1	119	7	When you forget, he requires more. 	35
4	1	119	8	How many of you have been sick this week?”	42
4	1	120	1	Mary started nodding a little.  	32
4	1	120	2	The hard seats did not feel comfortable. 	41
4	1	120	3	After what seemed like hours it finally ended.  	48
4	1	120	4	She got up feeling ruffled for just sitting there.  	52
4	1	120	5	She noticed her neck was drenched.  	36
4	1	120	6	As she walked out to return to her family, she saw a younger man passing his gaze at her and holding it.  	106
4	1	120	7	He lifted a corner smile and twinkled his eye in almost a wink. 	64
4	1	120	8	Mary froze still as George noticed and was looking at her. 	59
4	1	120	9	She looked up at him. 	22
4	1	120	10	He then turned his head towards the younger man who had turned his head away and had started to walk away.	106
4	1	121	1	George stared angrily at him.	29
4	1	122	1	“Who was that?”	15
4	1	123	1	“I don’t know.”	15
4	1	124	1	“Don’t lie to me Mary. 	23
4	1	124	2	You looked back at him.”	24
4	1	125	1	Mary clammed up and with it, George did too.  	46
4	1	125	2	My first argument with him already.  	37
4	1	125	3	Well, maybe it’s as they say, lovers who argue like an older couple have more to stick them together or something like this.  	126
4	1	125	4	Maybe he’s just protective.  	29
4	1	125	5	I really don’t mind that but I’m not used to this.  	52
4	1	125	6	If I’m in love, do I really need other suitors?	47
4	1	126	1	George took Mary to his home to have dinner in his two horse team wagon  As they arrived, various men she didn’t recognize were sitting in the cool shade inside his home with the door open.  	191
4	1	126	2	They were chowing down on something..	37
4	1	127	1	“Get out of here!”	18
4	1	127	2	, George bellowed. 	19
4	1	127	3	The way he did this scared Mary at first.  	43
4	1	127	4	He was a real brute alright but it got her a lot of notice. 	60
4	1	127	5	He softened back up when he had her sit down across from him at the table.  	76
4	1	127	6	“Mary, I’m so glad you would join me.  	39
4	1	127	7	I’m sorry if I was cross with you.  	36
4	1	127	8	I am not happy when other guys think they can step into another man’s business when it’s clear I was with you.”	111
4	1	128	1	“I know you were just being chivalrous George.”	47
4	1	129	1	“Mary, I don’t want this to end. 	33
4	1	129	2	I’m just …..afraid…. of losing you.” he stammered out.  	56
4	1	129	3	If men like him could cry, he would have but instead he stammered which was about as close as he got.  	103
4	1	129	4	“Tell me you feel the same as I do.”	36
4	1	130	1	“Well, I really don’t know for sure……”	38
4	1	131	1	“You love me don’t you!?”	25
4	1	131	2	, he asked looking very sad suddenly with his face frowning and brows sloping together. 	88
4	1	131	3	It seemed comical but too unusual to not be sincere.	52
4	1	132	1	Mary thought for a moment.  	28
4	1	132	2	She knew she was feeling something, she didn’t want to disappoint him after seeing him so angry.  	98
4	1	132	3	She felt a pressure build up inside her until the words blurted themselves out escaping into the open.	102
4	1	133	1	“I love you.”, she replied as convincing as she could.  	56
4	1	133	2	A warm thought passed her thoughts. 	36
4	1	133	3	She felt warm in here.  	24
4	1	133	4	It was a nice family home.  	28
4	1	133	5	He had a very cozy fire.  	26
4	1	133	6	He had done so many little things for her along the way.  	58
4	1	133	7	She couldn’t help it.	21
4	1	134	1	George pulled out a cask of wine.  	35
4	1	134	2	He poured it out for her.  	27
4	1	134	3	He got some pork out and bread and made her a plate.  	54
4	1	134	4	The wine smelled lovely.  	26
4	1	134	5	The pork was smokey flavored and delicious.	43
4	1	135	1	“The summer is almost at an end.  	34
4	1	135	2	We only  have so many Sundays when I can have you here in daylight and take you home as is proper.  	100
4	1	135	3	I don’t want people to get the wrong idea…..”, he paused….then she paused. 	75
4	1	135	4	He then let out a laugh, “Ho hahaha hahaha. 	44
4	1	135	5	Oh me.”. 	9
4	1	135	6	Mary gave a heartfelt chuckle in response.	42
4	1	136	1	They ate their fill.  	22
4	1	136	2	George looked outside.  	24
4	1	136	3	He had a stick in the yard that marked the shadows.	51
4	1	137	1	“Time to take you back.” he said interrupting her mid-bite.	59
4	1	138	1	He took her out and saw his brothers hard at chores, pulling ropes, lifting wood and angling it. 	97
4	1	138	2	He loaded her into the wagon and soon she was bumbling home with him on a warm sunset evening.  	96
4	1	138	3	He would stare at her looking her up and down.  	48
4	1	138	4	She felt shy.  	15
4	1	138	5	She was so new to love. 	24
4	1	138	6	He seemed so familiar with things.  	36
4	1	138	7	She tolerated it and for a moment, she felt like her charms must have kicked in.  	82
4	1	138	8	When they finally stopped, he looks over at here.	49
4	1	139	1	“I love you so much.”, his eyes teared but no sadness was in his face. 	71
4	1	139	2	It was a deep honest look.	26
4	1	140	1	“I love you too.”	17
4	1	141	1	He reached across and got closer to her, his,face, serious, focused, coming in.  	81
4	1	141	2	She blinked and then lowered her eyes, he lowered his eyelids and their lips touched as their eyes closed.  	108
4	1	141	3	He had such a commanding presence.  	36
4	1	141	4	The kiss was brief but seemed to last forever.  	48
4	1	141	5	He smiled at her as they parted stares.	39
4	1	142	1	“Come see me at the Tavern tomorrow?”	37
4	1	143	1	He held her hand as she stepped off and went into her home.  	61
4	1	143	2	Judith was there at the door again, looking worried.	52
4	1	144	1	“I’m glad you’re home.  	24
4	1	144	2	So how is his family? 	22
4	1	144	3	I take it you got to meet them all and eat together?”	53
4	1	145	1	“He’s very well to do mother.  	31
4	1	145	2	I…”	3
4	1	146	1	“I don’t mind that, I just want to know if his family is respectable and upright.  	83
4	1	146	2	Are they good people?”	22
4	1	147	1	“I think they’re very hardworking and industrious family.  	59
4	1	147	2	George is very quiet and private.  	35
4	1	147	3	We didn’t really talk to his family...but nothing to worry, they were close by and had already eaten.”	102
4	1	148	1	“It’s too early to tell Mary.”	30
4	1	149	1	Elizabeth and father broke in next. 	36
4	1	149	2	“Want to tell us any more?”	27
4	1	150	1	“Don’t press her!” 	19
4	1	150	2	retorted Judith.	16
4	1	151	1	“Mary’s in love! 	17
4	1	151	2	Mary’s in love!” 	17
4	1	151	3	shouted Thomas sliding down his chair joking. 	46
4	1	151	4	John Sr. sat him upright again.	31
4	1	152	1	John Sr. spoke to Mary once more: “You’ll never guess.”	55
4	1	153	1	“What is it?” 	14
4	1	153	2	asked Mary all eyes now trained on her.	39
4	1	154	1	“We’re getting a house maid tomorrow.”	38
4	1	155	1	“Hooray! 	9
4	1	155	2	That’s great. 	14
4	1	155	3	Now I won’t have to do dishes and I can keep these hands nice and soft for George.”	83
4	1	156	1	Eyes popped at that remark as Mary ended with a sheepish chuckle as if it had been a joke.	90
4	1	157	1	Mary finished the rest of that night in relative peace and quiet.  	67
4	1	157	2	More thoughts ran through her head.  	37
4	1	157	3	What if he wants to get married?  	34
4	1	157	4	I hope it’s not too soon that he asks.  	40
4	1	157	5	Mom would have a fit or …..throw me into it laughing.  	55
4	1	157	6	She hasn’t seemed all that worried about not having enough help now that she had a new house girl.	98
4	1	158	1	The next day at the tavern, Mary had finished up her chores, wore her prettiest outfit.  	89
4	1	158	2	She knew she would see her friends there but she did not catch sight of George anywhere.  	90
4	1	158	3	Joanne was there gabbing with a two other girls.  	50
4	1	158	4	They appeared related, older, one taller with a grey streak and bony face.  	76
4	1	158	5	The other a bit shorter, plumper with a spaced tooth and plump cheeks but the same eyes and nose as the other girl but a very wrinkly rouge and some hang of those cheeks over her neck.  	186
4	1	158	6	She had a smile that seemed to stick there.  	45
4	1	158	7	They both had dark eyebrows that seemed a little thick.	55
4	1	159	1	“Oh Mary, is that you? 	23
4	1	159	2	You look so majestic!”	22
4	1	160	1	“Hi Joanne, and you’re looking bright and lovely today.”	56
4	1	161	1	“Oh, go on. 	12
4	1	161	2	I was just telling Maybelle and Mehitable here all about your new gentleman suitor and how fortunate my new best friend is.”	124
4	1	162	1	“You both have such a grace about yourselves.” quipped Maybelle, Mehitable nodded.	82
4	1	163	1	“He’s so strong. 	17
4	1	163	2	I hear he’s already pulling in quite a good bit of trade with that ferry of his.” added Mehitable, “Please share with us what marvels he’s shown you.”	150
4	1	164	1	Mary blushed red in her ears and cheeks. 	41
4	1	164	2	She tried to think, she had rehearsed some of this in her mind already.	71
4	1	165	1	“He’s protective, chivalrous, doting.  	39
4	1	165	2	He seems very anxious to bring me in. 	38
4	1	165	3	Oh, and he has given me flowers, *sigh*, such a romantic	56
4	1	165	4	.	1
4	1	165	5	  “	3
4	1	166	1	“Not merely the strong big and simple type then.”	49
4	1	167	1	“He’s generous, witty, fun loving. ..oh and he sent me home with fabrics and a crate of flour…. that should keep me busy all winter.”	133
4	1	168	1	“You don’t think he’ll propose soon do you?”	44
4	1	168	2	, asked Maybelle.	17
4	1	169	1	“If he asks are you going to say yes?”	38
4	1	169	2	, asked Mehitable upstaging.	28
4	1	170	1	“I haven’t given it much thought yet, I mean I just met him…”, Mary said, stretching the fact she actually had given it a lot of thought given his signals.	155
4	1	171	1	“Oh Mary, you’re going to love it I’m sure.  	45
4	1	171	2	He may be older but he’s got connections and his family is Scottish nobility I hear.” said Joanne.	98
4	1	172	1	“He hasn’t told me that.”	25
4	1	173	1	Just then, George entered the small tavern room, slammed the door behind him. 	78
4	1	173	2	He went up to her and whispered harshly in her ear with the thick fume of alcohol and tobacco on his breath: “Mary, don’t let these old spinsters fill your head with nonsense.”  	178
4	1	173	3	He gave them a look and pulled Mary on his arm and marching out so fast Mary stumbled on the threshold. 	104
4	1	173	4	She turned back to give one last look of goodbye to the girls, her eyes open in a bit of astonishment.	102
4	1	174	1	He took her down to the drinking tables and put his arm around her and then looked at her sternly. 	99
4	1	174	2	“I don’t like those gossips.  	30
4	1	174	3	They’re full of wiles and plots that tend to break couples apart.  	67
4	1	174	4	They’re a bunch of harlots playing the game here.”  	52
4	1	174	5	Mary seemed a bit worried but it didn’t seem to her they were harlots, gossips perhaps but nothing about them seemed provocative in the least.  	144
4	1	174	6	In fact they looked more demure than she had.  	47
4	1	174	7	“If you’re seen with them, people will think you’re playing the same game.  	76
4	1	174	8	Not my Mary! 	13
4	1	174	9	Someone has to look out for ya.” 	33
4	1	174	10	Mary looked a little worried with a furled brow but tried to conceal it.  	74
4	1	174	11	“Now now, I was just looking out for you, cheer up, I’m here. 	62
4	1	174	12	So why are you so late?”	24
4	1	174	13	, he stared at her a bit bug eyed and serious.	46
4	1	175	1	Mary didn’t know if she dare mention the fact she had already been there too look for him. 	91
4	1	175	2	She decided it would be best to tell the truth. 	48
4	1	175	3	“I was here on time but saw my friends and did not see you, so I joined them.”	78
4	1	176	1	“Don’t lie to me Mary, I was here the whole time. 	50
4	1	176	2	Did you merely gaze a second and not see?”  	44
4	1	176	3	Mary looked out the window, a man was just hitching his horse and coach over the grass and the horses started to graze.  	121
4	1	176	4	She knew he was lying but she didn’t dare call him on that or call him a liar for it would be a grievous sin to be born if that word got out that she was scheming against her husband already.  	193
4	1	176	5	She could tell her story but they would only accept his and believe the worst about hers.	89
4	1	177	1	George took Mary out of view by a large cistern in a stack of empty crates, barrels and firkins. 	97
4	1	177	2	“I’m sorry, don’t be angered by me” sobbed Mary.	48
4	1	178	1	“Mary, I want you to promise me something.” said George, his mood changing to alleviate her concerns.	101
4	1	179	1	“Yes my dear?”	14
4	1	180	1	“I want you to swear, swear on the Testaments, Old and New, that you will not talk of me to others. 	100
4	1	180	2	The moment you do, is the moment the devil in his wiles will try to break apart our love with idle tales.  	107
4	1	180	3	You only need to talk to me of what troubles you. 	50
4	1	180	4	Will you swear it?””	20
4	1	181	1	Without a pause and with a fast beat in her heart, Mary mustered up the words, “I swear it on the Testaments.”	110
4	1	182	1	“Old and New”	13
4	1	183	1	“Old ..and New”	15
4	1	184	1	“Good, I will tell you something great and marvelous.”	54
4	1	185	1	“I have been assured I will have a contract with a yardmaster in Boston soon who is going to let me ship everything that comes in here.  	137
4	1	185	2	I’ll make sure you get the first cut of all the finest clothes, meats and ales I bring in. 	91
4	1	185	3	Don’t tell anyone though, it’s not final yet.  	47
4	1	185	4	I don’t want anyone to try and spoil my deal.  	47
4	1	185	5	Just think, Lord George Carr and Lady Mary Carr, the greatest of merchants and the first in line to sell to England.”	117
4	1	186	1	Mary thought in her mind of owning the tavern there, the trading posts, wearing beautiful dresses, gold, jewelry.  	115
4	1	186	2	She also felt a great deal of guilt.  	38
4	1	186	3	She didn’t want these things.  	31
4	1	186	4	She wanted love, comfort but not extravagance. 	47
4	1	186	5	She wanted peace and relaxation, not an endless keeping of books and bills, rosters and papers. 	96
4	1	186	6	She saw enough when she was in Bristol.  	41
4	1	186	7	She loved the idea of sailing in a ship over tranquil waters like the last time she was in love.  	98
4	1	186	8	Her thoughts went back to a place she dared not think about.  	62
4	1	186	9	Her heart sank a bit but then she looked at George and smiled at him.  	71
4	1	186	10	He smiled back.	15
4	1	187	1	“Kiss me.” he said.	19
4	1	188	1	She looked confused, he leaned in and kissed her, pressing his tongue around and bearing his strong body against hers.  	120
4	1	188	2	Something about this felt exhilarating, forbidden and enrapturing and yet she felt like she wasn’t in her own skin. 	116
4	1	188	3	He pulled away and caught her breathe.  	40
4	1	188	4	She could taste the fumes she had smelled earlier, there was a bitter and smoke to it, the smell of grains and his sweat full of pungent musks and human odor like a young man. 	176
4	1	188	5	She felt bewildered by all this. 	33
4	1	188	6	He pulled away, her eyes by now were dim and she saw stars.  	61
4	1	188	7	As her dizziness swirled to a rest and the lights came back she held herself back up.  	87
4	1	188	8	He gave a chuckle.  	20
4	1	188	9	She drooped her eyelids.  	26
4	1	188	10	He responded with a smile.  	28
4	1	188	11	She was glad to be back and amazed at his strength which he took as a satisfaction with his gestures.	101
4	1	189	1	“I hope that wasn’t too much.”	30
4	1	190	1	“No, it was nice George.”	25
4	1	191	1	“When can I see you again? 	27
4	1	191	2	Before church?”	15
4	1	192	1	“I can’t come back here this week. 	35
4	1	192	2	You could always come to visit us.  ”	37
4	1	193	1	George took her handkerchief. 	30
4	1	193	2	“I’ll return this to you on the morrow.”	40
4	1	194	1	“You could always ask my mother and father who are also here.”	62
4	1	195	1	“No need, I’ve got this worked out,” he stalled her, “I have something for you.”	80
4	1	196	1	George pulled out a gold-like necklace with a single garnet.	60
4	1	197	1	“It’s a pinchbeck. 	19
4	1	197	2	It’s not real gold but it looks like gold.”	43
4	1	198	1	“Oh George, that’s beautiful!” 	31
4	1	198	2	She admired the necklace running her hands over it. 	52
4	1	198	3	Mary’s weakness was jewelry. 	29
4	1	198	4	Her heart softened to the point her aching heart acted. 	56
4	1	198	5	She threw her arms around George and squeezed him tight and planted a peck on his lips.  	89
4	1	198	6	He embraced her again and more gently.  	40
4	1	198	7	They kissed for what seemed like hours.	39
4	1	199	1	Mary thought back to how George didn’t like those girls. 	57
4	1	199	2	She had to admit, she barely knew them either. 	47
4	1	199	3	Maybe he would be more impressed of her friend Margaret, not that they would ever meet but she wanted to let him know she had friends who were not just gossips. 	161
4	1	199	4	“George?”	9
4	1	200	1	“Yes?”	6
4	1	201	1	“Those girls back at the at the tavern. 	40
4	1	201	2	I should have you know they are merely acquaintances. 	54
4	1	201	3	I would never talk to them about real matters in my life.  	59
4	1	201	4	I do have a really good friend named Margaret in Charleston.”	61
4	1	202	1	“Really? 	9
4	1	202	2	What about her?” 	17
4	1	202	3	George pretensed interested but let her go on.	46
4	1	203	1	“Well, she’s a very skilled midwife. 	37
4	1	203	2	She has met a lot of important people. 	39
4	1	203	3	She knew Thomas Morton.”	24
4	1	204	1	“Merry Mount Thomas Morton?” 	29
4	1	204	2	his ears perked slightly as he glanced at her.	46
4	1	205	1	“The very same. 	16
4	1	205	2	He taught her all about the native wildlife, his magic, his arts and the nature of the tribes here. 	100
4	1	205	3	She is below her to gossip. 	28
4	1	205	4	She’s a very smart woman, well-dressed and very selective with friends. 	72
4	1	205	5	I think you would like her….but she is a lot older than me.”	60
4	1	206	1	George cowled at the thought of Indian tribes. 	47
4	1	206	2	He’d be happy if they were fully exterminated. 	47
4	1	206	3	“They’re just savages Mary. 	28
4	1	206	4	The last governor would have tried and hung Morton if he could. 	64
4	1	206	5	What I would really like is some help from the governors and magistrates in Boston to help me finance my river operation.”	122
4	1	207	1	“I’m sure she could help. 	26
4	1	207	2	But just so you know, Margaret didn’t go up to be with Morton or follow him. 	77
4	1	207	3	She was tempted but thought the better of it. 	46
4	1	207	4	He was a smart man even if he was full of errors. 	50
4	1	207	5	Margaret is much learned but she also knows when people have gone too far. 	75
4	1	207	6	She’s learned from the governor’s families too. 	48
4	1	207	7	Attended the same Dame Schools with their daughters. 	53
4	1	207	8	If you need help in Boston, I can ask her to introduce you around. 	67
4	1	207	9	Oh, and I don’t know if I ever told you about this but my brother fended off a raid of Indians. 	96
4	1	207	10	He was commended by John Winthrop himself.”	43
4	1	208	1	“I hope he took them all out. 	30
4	1	208	2	So what supernatural ability can you do Mary Perkins?”	54
4	1	209	1	“Well, my mother did teach me...well, I once started a fire from a distance.”	77
4	1	210	1	George pondered it as it sunk in but then shook it out of his head.	67
4	1	211	1	Mary heard her named called. 	29
4	1	211	2	She jumped up in the air. 	26
4	1	211	3	They both looked up, trying to make sure they didn’t look suspiciously messy. 	78
4	1	211	4	Her father was there to take her home so they both went back into view of the tavern folk. 	91
4	1	211	5	As they walked away, she kept her hands tight around the necklace.  	68
4	1	211	6	Her father was smiling and they spoke little as they walked up and down the hilly trails quickly to get home.  	111
4	1	211	7	They were both deep in thought the entire trek home.	52
4	1	212	1	George showed up at Mary’s home with a servant boy.  	53
4	1	212	2	George was dressed formally.  	30
4	1	212	3	John Sr. answered the door, “Mr. 	33
4	1	212	4	Perkins?”	9
4	1	213	1	“Hello?”	8
4	1	214	1	“George Carr wishes to traffic with you regarding an item he believes belongs to your daughter Mary..”	102
4	1	215	1	“Please bring him here so we may welcome him.”	46
4	1	216	1	“Sergeant Perkins Good Sir.”	28
4	1	217	1	“Welcome George”, John offered a handshake for which George heartily returned.	78
4	1	218	1	“I understand you have something that is my daughter’s?”	56
4	1	219	1	“In truth I do Good Sir” as George pulled out her handkerchief, “May I give this to Mary myself if it please you and she can presently come here?”	146
4	1	220	1	“Of course” replied John, “Mary!”	33
4	1	221	1	John realized he would need to wait a few minutes for her. 	59
4	1	221	2	“I hear you are designing to operate a ferry in all these waters.  	67
4	1	221	3	I have my home at the mouth of this river and I have the title to the rights there. 	84
4	1	221	4	Being that you are in good standing to take my daughter’s hand, should you wish to do so, I have a proposition that should be profitable to both of us. 	152
4	1	221	5	I would be happy to share the waterway I have and the trail I have with you if I could have a small interest in the Merrimack River.”	133
4	1	222	1	George grinned delightfully, “I would be most honored by your gesture of good will Sergeant.  	94
4	1	222	2	It is very generous for you to do offer this.  	47
4	1	222	3	If I could take you up on the offer this week, I have another shipment I could send you for it. 	96
4	1	222	4	Then I would be able to see how much this would be useful to me and I can designate a fair share based on that.”	112
4	1	223	1	“May I also visit with your daughter Good Sir? 	47
4	1	223	2	I had hoped to show Mary around the green today. 	49
4	1	223	3	I had also hoped to see her esteemed mother and father today if but briefly. 	77
4	1	223	4	I know I do not have your invitation yet.”	42
4	1	224	1	“Oh, of course George. 	23
4	1	224	2	Let’s have conversation after the Sunday meeting here. 	55
4	1	224	3	I ask that you bring her home before her supper before the sun touches down.  	78
4	1	224	4	Please let me know your acceptance and responding proposition at that time.”	76
4	1	225	1	Mary of course had been planning the morning for his visit and had brought out her perfumes and salves and pleasant looking cloths which she made.  	148
4	1	225	2	Elizabeth looked out, wearing one of the dresses George had sent them.	70
4	1	226	1	George took Mary in the arm as gentlemanly as he could.  	57
4	1	226	2	They walked to the green arm and arm and Mary started humming a hymn she had heard in church. 	94
4	1	226	3	George didn’t talk much until Mary had repeated her tune twice and had started into a third round: “I will talk to your father after Church on Sunday. 	151
4	1	226	4	I want you to borrow this and wear it.” 	40
4	1	226	5	George pulled out a gold necklace with a ruby and two emeralds in it.	69
4	1	227	1	“Oh, it’s lovely George”	24
4	1	228	1	“You’ll get this if we wed.”	28
4	1	229	1	“I have something for you.”	27
4	1	230	1	Mary pulls out a cloth scented with roses, rosemary, bergamot and lime. 	72
4	1	230	2	It had his initials stitched in with a thread of her hair.	58
4	1	231	1	“I made this for you.  	23
4	1	231	2	It isn’t a pricey thing but I made it just for you to keep you in good health and lift your spirits.”	101
4	1	232	1	George grimaced, “I don’t need your rags.  	43
4	1	232	2	I have too many.”	17
4	1	233	1	Mary’s eyes welled up and audibly sniffed.  	44
4	1	233	2	The walked several more steps, She lagged behind and hung her head low.	71
4	1	234	1	“Don’t start acting like a child. 	34
4	1	234	2	Stop your nonsense and carry yourself like a lady. ”	52
4	1	235	1	Mary wiped her eyes but sniffled again.	39
4	1	236	1	“I said stop or I will show you something better to cry about.”	63
4	1	237	1	She looked up at him like a sad pup as he puffed his chest out and pulled back his arms. 	89
4	1	237	2	She backed away scared. 	24
4	1	237	3	He lunged and picked her up by the waste and threw her on the ground.	69
4	1	238	1	“If you’re going to act like this, go back home and don’t follow me.”	69
4	1	239	1	Mary got up, her dressed stained, her sobs held back almost like sneezes stopped against her lips and puffed her cheeks.   	123
4	1	239	2	Her eyes were streaming and face was red.  	43
4	1	239	3	She looked dazed and bewildered as she stumbled with her next step.  	69
4	1	239	4	Something felt sprained. 	25
4	1	239	5	She could barely walk.	22
4	1	240	1	George stood there fuming, thinking.	36
4	1	241	1	Footsteps and voice could be heard in the distance. 	52
4	1	241	2	George’s face went a little white and his countenance changed into that of a worried nanny.	91
4	1	242	1	“Mary, oh look, I’m so sorry. 	30
4	1	242	2	Don’t say anything. 	20
4	1	242	3	Please don’t say anything!  	28
4	1	242	4	It’s it’s only because this is how all men in our family are trained.”  	72
4	1	242	5	Mary sobbed some more seeing it might be possible for her to let out.	69
4	1	243	1	“Here you go”, he pulled out a rag.  	37
4	1	243	2	Her lip was also cut somehow, possibly from her tooth from the force of her landing.  	86
4	1	243	3	Mary confused didn’t want to take the rag.  	44
4	1	243	4	“Come on Mary, here take it.” 	30
4	1	243	5	George looked around over his shoulders hearing more voices in the distance.  	78
4	1	243	6	Outlines like black toothpicks stood against the bright horizon and green hills.  	82
4	1	243	7	“I’m so sorry.  	16
4	1	243	8	It won’t happen again. 	23
4	1	243	9	I promise.  	12
4	1	243	10	I only do this because of my tradition. 	40
4	1	243	11	Women folk are to be loyal and they always are.  	49
4	1	243	12	They are more loyal than horses waiting for the first harvest of hay.  	71
4	1	243	13	It’s because of their husbands, they break their spirits like they break the spirit of a horse.  	97
4	1	243	14	It means they are interested in taking them as wives.  	55
4	1	243	15	Everyone does it where I am from.  	35
4	1	243	16	But not everyone here does it.  	32
4	1	243	17	It’s not something we can explain.  	36
4	1	243	18	Mary, please talk to me.  	26
4	1	243	19	You know what I want to do Sunday? 	35
4	1	243	20	I want to ask for your hand in marriage.  	42
4	1	243	21	You will love it, I promise you.  	34
4	1	243	22	I’m worried, I got confused. 	29
4	1	243	23	But I am sure I want you.  	27
4	1	243	24	Will you pledge to marry me?”	29
4	1	244	1	George scooped Mary and put his arms around her now hugging her.	64
4	1	245	1	“What’s the problem there?” 	28
4	1	245	2	a man approached over the crest of a hill.	42
4	1	246	1	“My lady has taken a fall, this mud is too treacherous for walking. 	68
4	1	246	2	It was a folly for me to try and show my betrothed around the green today. 	75
4	1	246	3	I have her care in my hand Good Sir.  	38
4	1	246	4	She’s not sorely hurt, just the mud on her dress”. 	51
4	1	246	5	He cupped Mary’s mouth a bit.  	31
4	1	246	6	“You’re ok aren’t you Mary?” 	29
4	1	246	7	he glared into her eyes closely.	32
4	1	247	1	“I’m ok” she shouted.	21
4	1	248	1	“Now wave to him.”.	19
4	1	249	1	Mary did as she was asked and waved.	36
4	1	250	1	“Are you going to the log sawing tomorrow?”	43
4	1	250	2	, said the man. 	16
4	1	250	3	George seemed to have recognized him.  	39
4	1	250	4	Someone Mary did not know..  	29
4	1	250	5	“Yes, I will be there.”, George waved.  	40
4	1	250	6	The man waved and walked away.	30
4	1	251	1	“Mary my beautiful, my beloved, I hurt inside when I can’t see you.  	69
4	1	251	2	My heart is torn. 	18
4	1	251	3	Please see that I am still loyal and honestly in love with you.  	65
4	1	251	4	You are my sun moon and stars Mary Perkins.  	45
4	1	251	5	Please stay with me.  	22
4	1	251	6	You will make my heart heal in time.  	38
4	1	251	7	I promise. 	11
4	1	251	8	I have something I want to give you tomorrow, Come to the timber yard. 	71
4	1	251	9	We’ll be having a log sawing competition and I will make you a lunch.  	71
4	1	251	10	It’s not more than an hour’s walk	33
4	1	251	11	.	1
4	1	251	12	“	1
4	1	252	1	He took Mary home but then asked.  	35
4	1	252	2	“Where is your wash at?”.  	27
4	1	252	3	Mary walked over to the water tub and boiling pot. 	51
4	1	252	4	“Good, you don’t need to dress the old queen around me as it is.”  	67
4	1	252	5	She went to the water tub and soaked the edge of her dress in the water.  	74
4	1	252	6	Her shins were raw with blood as she turned and landed on her knees and shins against the small stones when she took flew against the ground.  	143
4	1	252	7	Grass stained the edge of her dress.  	38
4	1	252	8	As she was washing, she looked over her shoulder and saw George walking away in his fine red coat and hat, his white stockings and neckcloth blurring in the distance.  	168
4	1	252	9	His hair almost matched his coat and he had a very manly muscled gait.  	72
4	1	252	10	His pants swished his coat tails as he moved, his weight seemed to blow everything around him.	94
4	1	253	1	At high noon, Mary strolled up to the timber yard in a dress that was much looser and shorter and older. 	105
4	1	253	2	It looked older and a size too small so that her petticoat occasionally flashed. 	81
4	1	253	3	George was in the heat of sawing with the long strokes of his saw, each stroke pulling massively against the wood grains and blowing sawdust out over the ground against his boots.  	181
4	1	253	4	His focus was intense and determined.  	39
4	1	253	5	His log was being sawed quickly down in what seemed just a few strokes compared to his contestant who was still sawing, lightly and rapidly in a futile effort to keep up.	170
4	1	254	1	Some of the younger boys were watching her come up.  	53
4	1	254	2	George had just won, sweating and standing up to cheers.  	58
4	1	254	3	A few men however instead of cheering were watching Mary walk up on the scene.	78
4	1	255	1	“Look who is coming over!” 	27
4	1	255	2	said one boy blemished all over his face.	41
4	1	256	1	“Oh, she looks hot and sweet.”, said the other.	47
4	1	257	1	“Do I smell perfume? 	21
4	1	257	2	I think I just raised my mast.” remarked the poxed face lad.	60
4	1	258	1	“Oh, she’s got my sails fluttering.” replied the other wiping a dribble from his face.	86
4	1	259	1	George looked over angrily at them, ready to knock them out. 	61
4	1	259	2	“That’s my girl young squeaker. 	32
4	1	259	3	Go away you little rats before I stomp your spines and grind them into the dirt with my boot.” 	95
4	1	259	4	They both looked at each other, got up and ran off.	51
4	1	260	1	George leaves the game in a huff and takes Mary behind the barn, pushing her up against the wall.  	99
4	1	260	2	“Is this how you show your support for me?”	43
4	1	261	1	“What did I do?  	17
4	1	261	2	I got here as soon as I could.”	31
4	1	262	1	“You show how much you love me by showing your petticoat to all the boys, playing the whore?”	93
4	1	263	1	“George, I didn’t have…”	24
4	1	264	1	“After all the dresses I gave you, you couldn’t find one modest dress?”	71
4	1	265	1	George ripped her dress at the hems, tattering it’s edges. 	59
4	1	265	2	Putting his coarse dirty hands all over her legs and squeezing them hard.	73
4	1	266	1	“Couldn’t you!?”	16
4	1	267	1	“George...I, I….”	17
4	1	268	1	“No Mary, you are not going to humiliate me to my family. 	58
4	1	268	2	Make use of what I give you or the whole engagement is off!”	60
4	1	269	1	“No George…”	12
4	1	270	1	“Don’t sass me! 	16
4	1	270	2	Go put some clothes on before the whole village thinks your a loose woman.”	75
4	1	271	1	Mary shivered and started to stutter back.	42
4	1	272	1	George pulled his hand back and slapped her, “I said do you hear me?!”	70
4	1	273	1	“Yes” she nodded, tears now coming out.	39
4	1	274	1	“You did this to incite my wrath Mary.  	40
4	1	274	2	You’re always inciting my anger.  	34
4	1	274	3	Good women do not such lewd and tempestuous manner.  	53
4	1	274	4	You lead men to hell like some evil whore like some hoary old witch if you keep this up.”  	91
4	1	274	5	George was so red in his face as to color his blue eyes a shade of green hazel.  	81
4	1	274	6	They were bloodshot and fierce.	31
4	1	275	1	He looked out and stomped off grabbing an earthen jug and marching back to his home.	84
4	1	276	1	Mary fell to sit on the ground and cried.  	43
4	1	276	2	She ran back home late and snuck to her bed in the dark when the candles went out.	82
4	1	277	1	That next morning, Judith looked at Mary and sensed something was very wrong.  	79
4	1	277	2	She looked at her and saw her shins. 	37
4	1	277	3	She got out the salve and dressed her wounds.  	47
4	1	277	4	She let her sleep in.	21
4	1	278	1	Judith went out of the home and to her new place.  	51
4	1	278	2	She gathered a pot and some hemp twine and took it with her.  	62
4	1	278	3	Her voice could almost be heard in the distance.  	50
4	1	278	4	It was a voice that only came with the severity of a hex.  	59
4	1	278	5	A hex that would hold George in his place for all his days to come.	67
4	1	279	1	When Mary got up, Judith was there watching over her.	53
4	1	280	1	“I won’t let your father give your hand to that man.”	53
4	1	281	1	“Mother?! 	10
4	1	281	2	He’s my best chance here. 	26
4	1	281	3	He has so much to give.”	24
4	1	282	1	“We don’t want what he has to give.”	36
4	1	283	1	“Didn’t he give you wonderful things?”	38
4	1	284	1	“Actually no, he gave us garbage, useless flour, full of weevil husks.  	72
4	1	284	2	He gave us dresses that were worn thin and ratty. 	50
4	1	284	3	You didn’t look at this?”	25
4	1	285	1	“No mother, I wanted those things for you.  	44
4	1	285	2	I thought this might encourage you to let me go. 	49
4	1	285	3	All the other girls are getting married by this age. 	53
4	1	285	4	Why don’t you let me live my life?”	35
4	1	286	1	“You are still too young for that man Mary. 	44
4	1	286	2	Let him go. 	12
4	1	286	3	He’s not good for you. 	23
4	1	286	4	Besides, those girls are foolish to act so rashly, marrying the first man that comes along. 	92
4	1	286	5	You should have many suitors and when you have had time to settle in here. ”	76
4	1	287	1	“Mother, I do love him. 	24
4	1	287	2	He’s just protective of me and fights to keep me his.”	54
4	1	288	1	“Mary, that’s enough. 	22
4	1	288	2	You’re not going to let him treat you like this. 	49
4	1	288	3	Please listen to me.  	22
4	1	288	4	You are ready for life but you don’t need to rush.  	52
4	1	288	5	Just consider my words. 	24
4	1	288	6	I won’t force you but I ask you to consider my words deep in your heart mind and soul and ask yourself if you truly love him and if he truly loves you.”	152
4	1	289	1	“Mother, thank you. 	20
4	1	289	2	Don’t worry, I will think about what you have said. 	52
4	1	289	3	I do have chores to do.”	24
4	1	290	1	“Mary, I care about you. 	25
4	1	290	2	You are gifted beyond your own wisdom and courage and everything tells me to give it time and not hasten the time of your marriage. 	132
4	1	290	3	It will come soon enough.  	27
4	1	290	4	You cannot neglect your gift.  	31
4	1	290	5	Develop it.  	13
4	1	290	6	Let it work for you.”  	23
4	1	290	7	Judith hugged Mary. 	20
4	1	290	8	Mary got up and dressed and took the pail with her to milk the cows that morning.	81
4	1	291	1	That Sunday, George was at church. 	35
4	1	291	2	Dressed in his same fine clothes that they went to the green with.  	68
4	1	291	3	He looked haggard and his eyes bloodshot in the face.  	55
4	1	291	4	His age was showing.  	22
4	1	291	5	He reeked of drinking and vomit but looked outwardly clean.  	61
4	1	291	6	Mary was not feeling her usual admiration for him.  	52
4	1	291	7	Instead of looking handsome, he looked ill and restless.  	58
4	1	291	8	He approached her and quietly took her hand.  	46
4	1	291	9	She held it. 	13
4	1	291	10	I will have to talk to him after this letting him know I cannot continue with him.  	84
4	1	291	11	But let me sit with him now so as to maintain reverence here at the chapel they’ve graciously taken me into.  	110
4	1	291	12	His hands felt cooler to the touch but hard and firm like stone.  	66
4	1	291	13	Mary’s head was throbbing with a headache.  	44
4	1	291	14	The dusty smell of the church made her nose cold and she sneezed audibly.  	75
4	1	291	15	The reverend was late arriving so they all waited.  	52
4	1	291	16	George looked over at Mary with a scowl and farted loudly smirking to himself.  	80
4	1	291	17	Several of his younger male peers and friends laugh at him. 	60
4	1	291	18	Mary’s face turned red.  	25
4	1	291	19	One of the ladies in the pew in front turned around and stared him in the eyes.  	81
4	1	291	20	Her countenance was like that of a bulldog wearing a neck cloth, she pointed her finger at him, “Reverence or we shall have to take you out with your foul air.”	160
4	1	292	1	“Old hag, turn around and mind yourself. 	41
4	1	292	2	I’ve had to put up with you old stinking bags for weeks.”	57
4	1	293	1	“Young lady, does he do this at home?”	38
4	1	294	1	“Old hag, her mind is infirm, she can’t hear you, nor will she talk to ...”	75
4	1	295	1	“I can hear you perfectly fine madam.”, Mary jumped in cutting him off, prefacing the feelings she would later have to reveal to him about their relationship.	158
4	1	296	1	“Don’t you contradict me publicly.  	36
4	1	296	2	A woman obeys her man and agrees with his opinions in public”	61
4	1	297	1	“I am not yours yet.” yelled Mary.	34
4	1	298	1	“Well, you tried to be mine, you temptress, you witch.  	56
4	1	298	2	Your old pop tried to bribe me and all the boys saw you in the way flashing your petticoat and muttering to yourself and now I wonder if it was worth trying to take you back to the Lord.”, George smirked covering his tracks with a pretense of taking a wayward woman back to the grace of God.	291
4	1	299	1	Several voices gasped as he spoke but they did not immediately take George’s side as intimidating as he was. 	109
4	1	299	2	Mary’s family was sitting a few pews behind.  	46
4	1	299	3	John Sr. kept an eagle’s eye on George.  	41
4	1	299	4	He knew he couldn’t fight him verbally without violating their reverence or physically so he set out to outwit him.  	117
4	1	299	5	He whispered to the other congregationalists they had become acquainted with after George left.	95
4	1	300	1	“Leave her be. 	15
4	1	300	2	Be peaceable here or both of you will leave” said the woman’s husband sitting an elbow away.	92
4	1	301	1	With that George grabbed Mary by the arm and took her outside and pulled her to his wagon.  	92
4	1	301	2	George pulled out a long black leather braided whip she had seen him use on his teams.	86
4	1	302	1	He pushed Mary against the church bricks and stepped back a pace. 	66
4	1	302	2	Mary tried to dart left away from him, scared and heart throttled.	66
4	1	303	1	“You are going to learn obedience Mary, if not from your father then from me!” 	79
4	1	303	2	yelled George blocking her exit.  	34
4	1	303	3	Mary looked around a few seconds but George’s eyes were trained on her waiting for her to move.  	97
4	1	303	4	She felt so trapped.  	22
4	1	303	5	She looked one way for a second in deception.  	47
4	1	303	6	It partially worked, as she darted the other way toward the road, she gained some distance but not enough.  	108
4	1	303	7	With a couple whirrs heard behind her, she trips in reflex to the pain that suddenly rips cloth and skin over her left shoulder blade.  	136
4	1	303	8	She feels a burn as the sound of the whip crack echoes in her ears. 	68
4	1	303	9	In confusion, her experiences jumbled out of the normal sequence of time, she looked over her shoulder to see a grinning man, a blur of red, laughing at her.  	159
4	1	303	10	He stomped over to where she was to gain ground.  	50
4	1	303	11	She ran around the corner of the church building.  	51
4	1	303	12	He circled the corner cautiously, which avoided him bumping into the crowd just walking out gathering to the noise.  	117
4	1	303	13	Mary hid behind them sobbing.  	31
4	1	303	14	Judith took her into the building as her father, Elizabeth and a just-arrived Reverend and several able young men beside him stood there staring at him.	152
4	1	304	1	“It isn’t what it looks like. 	30
4	1	304	2	She is being punished justly for dishonoring God.  	51
4	1	304	3	She deserved it for her sinful behavior.  	42
4	1	304	4	She’s crazy people.”	20
4	1	305	1	John Sr. looks at George in the eye and pulls out a club. 	58
4	1	305	2	Several other people pull out clubs. 	37
4	1	305	3	They chased him down and backed him into the brush.  	53
4	1	305	4	John Jr, Elizabeth, the Reverend and a man she had never seen before about Elizabeth’s age, came over and held him down as John Sr. came up to him quietly and then suddenly without warning as George was about to open his mouth, clubbed him in the face bloodying his nose.	271
4	1	306	1	“The answer is no. 	19
4	1	306	2	Furthermore, Let you be thus accursed from this day forward: You will never take my daughter’s hand. 	101
4	1	306	3	Nor my daughters daughter, nor your son’s sons.  	49
4	1	306	4	And further still, neither you, nor your sons will come between us and the hands my children and grandchildren take. 	117
4	1	306	5	And no, you will not let your ships ride upon my water nor yours horses on my land or more will come than you see here.  	121
4	1	306	6	Stay on your own parcel and never let me see you again.”	56
5	1	1	1	The sun cast long shadows over the stones and trees like wispy poppets stretched still over the ground.	103
5	1	2	1	The familiar pattern of bumps told Mary they would soon arrive home.  	70
5	1	2	2	Mary felt the ominous prospects of a thunderous lecture as low darkening clouds rolled over her head. 	102
5	1	2	3	There were gusts of breeze blowing over and around them.	56
5	1	3	1	When they finally arrived, Mary took Lydia from mom’s arms. 	60
5	1	3	2	Elizabeth looked like she had completely gotten over her limp and walked briskly carrying a basket of clothes for the baby and biscuits for the boys.  	151
5	1	3	3	John Sr. took the club out and prodded the ground with it like a walking stick as if fancying for a moment that he would take on the look of more senior members of society. 	173
5	1	3	4	John Jr, took the team to water and soon all were inside, shielded from the winds.	82
5	1	4	1	“Mary”, Elizabeth started, “I’ve been meaning to speak with you.”	65
5	1	5	1	“Yes?”	6
5	1	6	1	“Well, I don’t want you to take anything here the wrong way.  	62
5	1	6	2	You might be upset still but I do want you to hear this because I do greatly feel that you have been delivered just in time from a great worse calamity than what happened today.”	178
5	1	7	1	“If you are going to talk about George, do not say another word.”	65
5	1	8	1	“Mary, there’s are secrets I’ve not only heard but seen for myself.  	69
5	1	8	2	Then you will see why I have to burn this dress.”	49
5	1	9	1	“Ok, Elizabeth, what are you talking about?”	44
5	1	10	1	“I will start with some things you probably already know and then go on from there because this needs to be said from the start and I cannot say what you already know so I would ask your patience so I can get through it all because there is so much.”	250
5	1	11	1	“Then do tell it Elizabeth.”	28
5	1	12	1	“George is about 37 years old.  	32
5	1	12	2	He was married once before.”	28
5	1	13	1	Mary’s jaw dropped. 	20
5	1	13	2	George had never told her about himself, his family or his past.  	66
5	1	13	3	As much as she had tried, he had kept himself a clean handsome looking mystery.  	81
5	1	13	4	It might have even been part of the allure.	43
5	1	14	1	“Shall I continue?” 	20
5	1	14	2	Elizabeth asked followed by nods from Mary, her eyes welling up a bit.	70
5	1	15	1	“His wife, Lucinda Davenport was with him at Plymouth.  	56
5	1	15	2	There was a curse at that place and she died.  	47
5	1	15	3	Some say it was his neglect that killed her although many able-bodied men also died because of the harsh winter there..  	121
5	1	15	4	He has since tried to date many young girls.”	45
5	1	16	1	“That’s not so bad Elizabeth, that happens.”	44
5	1	17	1	“It just seems suspect to me Mary.  	36
5	1	17	2	But that’s not all, he not only kept secrets from you but also his family and tried to keep us away.  	102
5	1	17	3	He was not honest with us.  	28
5	1	17	4	The ‘fabric’ he sent us was the old clothes his wife used to wear and he gave us the bad flour which we had to throw out in the field.  	136
5	1	17	5	He lied about you too, said you tried to seduce him, would show him your legs, was acting strange, and couldn’t tell what you were going on about.  	148
5	1	17	6	Things about him just didn’t add up and I have a bad feeling he won’t give up.  	80
5	1	17	7	He keeps slave girls and uses them.”	36
5	1	18	1	Mary was fuming.	16
5	1	19	1	“Stop Elizabeth, I, let me leave you. 	38
5	1	19	2	I, I need quiet. 	17
5	1	19	3	You have told me more than I can bear right now.”	49
5	1	20	1	Mary’s thoughts were a blur of questions, rage and pain. 	57
5	1	20	2	There were even pains of missing George in between feelings of anger.  	71
5	1	20	3	What did I do to deserve this?  	32
5	1	20	4	Did I think it and therefore it was?  	38
5	1	20	5	She sat on her bedding pile in the corner arguing with herself in her own mind.  	81
5	1	20	6	I am going mad.  	17
5	1	20	7	Her face went red and she mumbled incoherently with What..?	59
5	1	20	8	Why…? 	6
5	1	20	9	and How?  	10
5	1	20	10	Her mind and body ached.  	26
5	1	20	11	Her sleep was ruined. 	22
5	1	20	12	Bags went under her eyes.  	27
5	1	20	13	She held a pillow tightly.  	28
5	1	20	14	She couldn’t eat and was wasting thin. 	39
5	1	20	15	For days she sat there.  	25
5	1	20	16	I’ll never trust another man again.  	37
5	1	20	17	There were horrible thoughts of harming herself, doing away with herself.	73
5	1	21	1	Judith looked woefully through the curtains of her new home in Ipswich.  	73
5	1	21	2	Lydia was crawling on a blanket in front of her.  	50
5	1	21	3	Judith placed toys around her, watching her movement, her choices, keeping a note and imagining her future personality.  	121
5	1	21	4	Her curly hair and rosy cheeks make her the most doll like baby she had ever seen despite the hardships of settling into the wild new land.  	141
5	1	21	5	She admired her daughter Mary for taking a stand but was also reliving the horrible details.  	94
5	1	21	6	Mary was withdrawn and she had to do something to help her daughter.  	70
5	1	21	7	Elizabeth was not doing much better but at least she had gone out on a date last night that ended dreamily.  	109
5	1	21	8	A man by the name of William Sargent Sr. was thin and wirey.  	62
5	1	21	9	His frame was bony and he had an honest and plain look about him. 	66
5	1	21	10	He was even more the sensible type and very industrious and resourceful.  	74
5	1	21	11	He had a wide set of skills that enabled him to do all the work imaginable on a farm.  	87
5	1	21	12	He had big blue eyes and when he wasn’t intensely focused, he had a wide and cheerful smile with a thick countryside accent.  	126
5	1	21	13	Judith had a good feeling about him after Elizabeth had spent the last four months dating without anyone making a call on her again. 	133
5	1	21	14	No letters, nothing.  	22
5	1	21	15	William Sargent wrote her every week.  	39
5	1	21	16	His writing was simple and plain but to the point compared to other gentry:	75
5	1	23	1	My Dear Elizabeth, How are you this lovely day? 	48
5	1	23	2	I wish you a plentiful increase and comfort in the Lord.  	58
5	1	23	3	Would you that I see you at the banquet again and take you to meet my family again?  	85
5	1	23	4	Your mother and father are most kind and it was truly a blessing to see them. 	78
5	1	23	5	May God prosper them in His graceful Hand.   	45
5	1	23	6	My family is still in Bath but I wish they could meet you.  	60
5	1	23	7	I have written them telling them of my fortune in finding a fair lady to keep me company.  	91
5	1	23	8	For our courtship, I have a gift for you which I will bring to your family’s home so they will remember how I have pledged to your care.  	138
5	1	23	9	If they so approve, I would ask another gift should the right time come.  	74
5	1	23	10	In devotion to you as I also devote to the Lord as he devoted Himself to the church and kingdom of God.  	105
5	1	23	11	So may we meet again soon.	26
5	1	24	1	In love, William Sargent.	25
5	1	26	1	Elizabeth freely shared her letters with her mother.  	54
5	1	26	2	Judith smiled and then thought of Mary and woefully looked on as she churned the butter.  	90
5	1	26	3	Mary had kept her head down and in her work.  	46
5	1	26	4	When a man came looking for her, Mary would avoid it.  	55
5	1	26	5	Judith would sometimes turn them away. 	39
5	1	26	6	Mary saw the warning signs much more clearly.  	47
5	1	26	7	There were many fine men but Mary was inconsolable.  	53
5	1	26	8	She would go out with them.  	29
5	1	26	9	They would write her.  	23
5	1	26	10	She would not answer.  	23
5	1	26	11	She would not talk to them.  	29
5	1	26	12	Mary even offered to stay home from the public view.  	54
5	1	26	13	She stayed home from church and read and watched and fed Lydia.  	65
5	1	26	14	Thomas and Jacob were growing up like weeds and started to go fishing and hunting with some coaching from their brother John Jr.	128
5	1	27	1	John Sr slammed the door behind him.	36
5	1	28	1	“I just got a letter from John Endecott.  	42
5	1	28	2	Goodwife Endecott wants Mary to go there to help as a midwife.  	64
5	1	28	3	He will pay her nineteen pence a day with room, board, washings, one hog and firkin of butter for the week we lose our increase due to her labors here.  	153
5	1	28	4	Isn’t that great news?!”	24
5	1	29	1	John looked to cheer her up but he could see how hard it was to get her to smile.	81
5	1	30	1	“Lift up your head Mary, he’s not going to give us a very fat hog if you look on so dreadfully.” he smiled and chuckled a little then tickled her under the arm like he used to do when she was in her insolently stubborn moods as a tot.  	236
5	1	30	2	He gave him a tickle back but he was completely immune to it.  	63
5	1	30	3	She knew better but tried anyway.  	35
5	1	30	4	“There, that’s better Mary, keep laughing, it’s better medicine than that vinegar you’ve been taking.” he teased.	113
5	1	31	1	“Judy, what am I going to do with both my girls out of the house?”	66
5	1	32	1	Judith looked at her reflection in the water of the pot she just put on.  	74
5	1	32	2	It would be a long time before it would boil.  	47
5	1	32	3	There were a few more grays there than last time.	49
5	1	33	1	“I’ll get the boys to do some of the work.  	44
5	1	33	2	This will be good for them.” replied Judith, “I’ll send a reply.  	66
5	1	33	3	I’m going to have John Jr. take her up and bring her back. 	59
5	1	33	4	I’ll let Former Governor Endecott know he need not send for her personally.  	77
5	1	33	5	John, you need to teach Mary how to ride properly side saddle, our wagon needs repair.”	87
5	1	34	1	The day came early spring for Mary to go up with her brother John Jr.  	71
5	1	34	2	She rode behind him wearing safeguards from the splattering mud on the road having learned how to ride side-saddle.  	117
5	1	34	3	Governor Retired Endecott introduced them to his wife Elizabeth Endecott.  	75
5	1	34	4	John left Mary at Goodwife Endecott’s side and warned her to keep close by her lest her husband try something nefarious.  	122
5	1	34	5	Mary prepared herbs, boiled and hung sheets and clothes and stockpiled them against the day of delivery.  	106
5	1	34	6	When Good Wife Endecott’s day was due, she produced a small baby boy.  	71
5	1	34	7	John Endecott was present for the whole thing and spoke loquaciously of himself as his son was born.	100
5	1	35	1	“As I have so been blessed by the grace of God to have founded this land of Zion for the deliverance of God’s chosen people, delivered from the temptations of papacy and evils therewith.  	188
5	1	35	2	As it is just and good that we are all witness to the coming of the Kingdom in our own day, I shall name my son in memory of the prince who lead the Jews from Babylon back to Jerusalem as this was a shadowed form of things that would transpire.  	246
5	1	35	3	For isn’t England and Rome become too great in their own eyes, lead by vanity like unto the Babylonians with the fine Babylonian garments, fine food and fine treasures?  	170
5	1	35	4	We are lead from the flesh pots of Egypt and from the riches of Babylon to a new holy land given by the providence of God to those who have heard his voice in the wilderness”	174
5	1	36	1	Mary’s ears tired as he continued, speaking of how evil the British were, how the times were getting more wicked with that man at Merry Mount.  	144
5	1	36	2	How they must stay vigilant against the devil who would come to tempt them and make deals with them to lay traps against the righteous and so on.  	147
5	1	36	3	Her ears perked as he said what she had waited to hear..	56
5	1	37	1	“I shall name him Zerubbabel.”	30
5	1	38	1	He went on some more.  	23
5	1	38	2	He then heard her name.	23
5	1	39	1	“And blessed are these girls who have come to serve him like the women who served at the feet of Jesus. 	104
5	1	39	2	Martha here has been an instrument in God’s own hands blessing us with a healthy baby boy.”	91
5	1	40	1	He erred in her name.  	23
5	1	40	2	She was taken aback but smiled just the same.  	47
5	1	40	3	Let it go it is no harm.  	26
5	1	40	4	came a voice.  	15
5	1	40	5	She kept thinking this might be his way of making matters worse if anything bad should happen to his son who he seemed intent on pampering like a prince. 	154
5	1	40	6	It was ironic since he decried the sin of Pride upon the royal heads in England.	80
5	1	41	1	“Do you have a word Martha? 	28
5	1	41	2	Prophesy Martha!”...”	21
5	1	41	3	Prophesy!” 	11
5	1	41	4	were the voices raised.	23
5	1	42	1	Mary was a little shocked.  	28
5	1	42	2	She knew there were subtle differences in prophecy and the speaking heard in church but Mary’s calling was in fact related to such a gift of the Spirit as they saw...something natural and unexplainable as she saw it.  	218
5	1	42	3	So she let her mouth spew the first things that leaped into her mind.  	71
5	1	42	4	Her mind was on medical things….	32
5	1	43	1	”This baby will be a blessing to you all to be sure.  	54
5	1	43	2	He shall one day be a great doctor in this land and have a son of his own the same as himself.”  	97
5	1	43	3	A gasp or two was heard around the room.  	42
5	1	43	4	Then a few cheers.  	20
5	1	43	5	Some seemed unsure if they should cheer or not so the sound broke off early.	76
5	1	44	1	The Governor had much family and friends waiting outside after he had covered his wife’s nakedness whom he had brought in.  	124
5	1	44	2	After Mary had spoke to this crowd, and as there was a moment of pause, he picked back up again. 	97
5	1	44	3	Some stayed for a feast.  	26
5	1	44	4	Mary didn’t feel hungry.  	26
5	1	44	5	She didn’t know the Governor as someone who would make a falsehood if more than two people knew it but she also knew she had better work hard for what she was promised in pay.  	177
5	1	44	6	So she continued to take care of Goodwife Endecott and a couple nights after, John Jr, came just in time.  	107
5	1	44	7	The baby’s odour was filling the room and she was not about to stay and clean the whole thing.  	96
5	1	44	8	Before she left, she did the best she could to put the used cloths in a bucket, ready for taking out to wash.  	111
5	1	44	9	That wasn’t her job after all.	30
5	1	45	1	When Mary arrived home with her pay and new livestock, they all cheered and hugged her and kissed her on the cheek.  	117
5	1	45	2	Her mood was lifted by this.  	30
5	1	45	3	Judith broke in, “Even as you travelled back, word has spread that you have worked well for Mr. 	96
5	1	45	4	Endecott.  	11
5	1	45	5	There are some men who have been employed in the keeping us safe from raiding tribes who have started to grow restless and started to aim their arrows at those who have gone out alone in the woods.  	199
5	1	45	6	The Narragansett are becoming more uneasy with us.  	52
5	1	45	7	We’re seeing more wounded come our way.  	41
5	1	45	8	They will be sending some injured to us.  	42
5	1	45	9	Thanks to your work we can afford to fix our carts.”	52
5	1	46	1	“I’ll do my best mother.”	25
5	1	47	1	Late one night, the sound of a muffled man and shuffling in the bushes could be heard in the distance outside Mary’s window.  	126
5	1	47	2	John Sr, with his excellent ears and instincts got out of his restful snooze that evening and put on his night robe. 	117
5	1	47	3	There in a flaxen raincover for a small cart with  ropes tied to it in sheet bend knots in a makeshift stretcher was a man gagged and biting down in pain.  	156
5	1	47	4	Mary watched as they came in through the door.  	48
5	1	47	5	A thin shard of stone tied to a stick broken near the skin, the tip of a native arrow was lodged into his left hip. 	116
5	1	47	6	Mary could see that it would have just missed his kidney but shattered his hip bones. 	86
5	1	47	7	Blood was dripping through the course cloth onto their floor.  	63
5	1	47	8	They laid him directly onto the floor and ungagged him.  	57
5	1	47	9	He was still biting and yammering through clenched teeth.	57
5	1	48	1	Mary went to boil a pot of water and threw in some herbs.  	59
5	1	48	2	She pulled out a box of her natural treasures and opened it.  	62
5	1	48	3	Inside was a small earthen pot of salve made with Helichrysum and Yarrow and another styptic of goldenseal root powder, white poppy heads, ground fine with the mortar and pestle mixed with the pale, waxy bloom of some berries she had seen the sachems use.	255
5	1	49	1	“Please take it out!” 	22
5	1	49	2	whimpered the man.	18
5	1	50	1	Mary knew that this would increase bleeding and cause him to faint.  	69
5	1	50	2	That never ended well even though it was thought that excess throbbing and inflammation of the wound was a sign of excess humor.  	130
5	1	50	3	Still, the blood carried the soul so there was already too much blood lost.  	77
5	1	50	4	There was no sign of poison.  	30
5	1	50	5	He wouldn’t be alive if there were.  	37
5	1	50	6	She washed her hands.	21
5	1	51	1	Mary looked at him in sympathy but gave no response to his request.  	69
5	1	51	2	She motioned to the two men who had dragged him in the makeshift bag-like stretcher.  	86
5	1	51	3	“Hold him down. 	16
5	1	51	4	Put the cloth under his neck and muzzle him, do not gag him, let him bite it.”	78
5	1	52	1	She took the cloth and wrung it out over his flesh.  	53
5	1	52	2	She applied the powder next over the arrow, then the salve and then packed around it with some hen down that she had boiled and dried.  	136
5	1	52	3	It was extremely absorbent and held the blood in.  	51
5	1	52	4	He whimpered as she went around barely touching the stick.  	60
5	1	52	5	She looked at it closely wondering how risky it would be to loosen it.  	72
5	1	52	6	She couldn’t tourniquet him.  	30
5	1	52	7	What do I do here?  	20
5	1	52	8	If only Margaret were here.  	29
5	1	52	9	Judith watched and helped, passing her a clean dry cloth packed in the cedarwood.	81
5	1	53	1	Mary readied the cloth and slowly pulled at the stick.  	56
5	1	53	2	If it was red, she’d let it slip back.  	40
5	1	53	3	What to do?  	13
5	1	53	4	As she watched, it turned red a little but didn’t gush.  	57
5	1	53	5	All or nothing!  	17
5	1	53	6	She quickly pulled the stick out, packed in the down and overlaid more salve.  	79
5	1	53	7	Judith handed her some thin goat kid skin and she wrapped it around his waist to hold it in place.	98
5	1	54	1	“He’s going to need a sleep elixir so he can sleep comfortably and heal himself.”, she emptied her hands and went to make a drink for him.  	140
5	1	54	2	She mixed some tincture into some hot water and had him sip it.	63
5	1	55	1	Judith told the men, “Come back to check on him in three days and then we can say more if he stay or go.”	105
5	1	56	1	The next night, they took a young boy in. 	42
5	1	56	2	He had wandered off and came home with injuries and had fainted on the way.  	77
5	1	56	3	Mary had to bind his limb and sew him back.  	45
5	1	56	4	Elizabeth and William had come to watch and help out.  	55
5	1	56	5	Mary’s work was starting to draw a crowd as she was becoming well known as a saver of lives and an inspired healer.  	117
5	1	56	6	Even Cotton Mather started to take notice.	42
5	1	57	1	As there were smallpox outbreaks, there were people whom Mary could not help but if they were injured, she would try.  	119
5	1	57	2	Mary avoided going into town on account of George but wherever she went, people were saying things after she passed like “There goes the youngest physick of Ipswich”, “Is that Mary Perkins the sister of John Perkins the Quartermaster?”	235
5	1	57	3	, “Is that Mary the daughter of John Perkins?”	46
5	1	57	4	, “Is that Mary who was once engaged to George?”	48
5	1	57	5	, “Didn’t George say she was a witch?” 	39
5	1	57	6	to which people would usually say, “No!	39
5	1	57	7	, the prince of demons would not cast out demons.” but on one occasion, she heard, “That Mary may heal but even the demons heal their future pawns. 	148
5	1	57	8	She’s the worst witch of Ipswich” to which Mary became afraid.  	64
5	1	57	9	She remembered the gory scene painted by Margaret and decided to go into town with a scarf around her face from that time on and her neck cloth pulled up as if to ward herself from the stale airs and coughs looking much older than her true age.	244
5	1	58	1	Over time, Mary collected and preserved eggs, honey, tree sap, bee propolis, milk, spider webs, milkweed tufts, down, skins, barks, wine, salves and tinctures for her medical preparations. 	189
5	1	58	2	The cinchona bark in particular she found useful as well as the yarrow, goldenseal and opium powder.	100
5	1	59	1	Five days had passed until this one morning, a knock came at the door.  	72
5	1	59	2	It was hard to tell these days if it was William Sergeant, brother John, father John, Elizabeth or a new patient.  	115
5	1	59	3	Mary had given up on dating and Elizabeth was going steady with William now.  	78
5	1	59	4	Mary had a hunch this would be a patient.	41
5	1	60	1	Judith got the door with Mary standing behind her.  	52
5	1	60	2	The older reverend and a man with brassy wavy hair stood there being held up by the reverend’s arm.  	101
5	1	60	3	“This man came to church for healing, believing he would be healed.  	69
5	1	60	4	God works in his own ways and for this cause I’m here to bring you a new patient Miss Perkins. 	95
5	1	60	5	I believe you have the Gift of Healing?”	40
5	1	61	1	Mary knew the verse in the bible was in Mark.  	47
5	1	61	2	She pulled out her medicine chest which had been replaced with a bigger box now that she had collected so many more things.  	125
5	1	61	3	The reverend quoted the verse, “And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”	319
5	1	62	1	The right pant leg was sticky with blood which had dried like a paint.  	72
5	1	62	2	Judith took away the cover on a table they reserved for Mary’s operations.  	76
5	1	62	3	Mary laid him down on the smooth table they had kept covered and cleaned. 	74
5	1	62	4	He was large framed and looked a bit familiar.  	48
5	1	62	5	He seemed so strong and yet, he almost pulled Mary down with his weight when he tried to seat himself so much that Judith came over to take his other arm.  	156
5	1	62	6	He was looking dizzy but still there.	37
5	1	63	1	“The...lights are dark.”	24
5	1	64	1	Mary could tell he had lost about enough blood to lose his consciousness.  	75
5	1	64	2	As they laid him down, they both struggled with his weight.  	61
5	1	64	3	Mary went to grab a shear to cut his pants to inspect his wound.  	66
5	1	64	4	As she peeled the blood stiffened fabric, it appeared to be a musket wound on one side and a large gelatinous blob of flesh on the exit side.  	143
5	1	64	5	Mary marveled at the fact he had not passed out sooner.	55
5	1	65	1	Mary felt a spark of infatuation upon undressing him despite the grotesqueness of his wounds so much that she held her feelings in check as she went to work, sometimes losing track of what to get next stuck in mid-thought.  	224
5	1	65	2	Judith noticed something about this and took over.	50
5	1	66	1	Judith had to debride the frayed skin.  	40
5	1	66	2	Judith undressed him until he was completely nude from the waist down.  	72
5	1	66	3	Mary watched in awe as she had seldom seen the sex of a man around her age.  	77
5	1	66	4	His vulnerability and masculinity overwhelmed her.  	52
5	1	66	5	Mary watched on in a trance as she handed mother the things she asked for.  	76
5	1	66	6	Judith washed some of the dirt away but made use of the styptic powder in great quantities.  	93
5	1	66	7	There was none left so she sent Mary away to make more.	55
5	1	67	1	Mary went into the fields, thinking about what she saw and decided to block it from her mind.  	95
5	1	67	2	She picked up more yarrow along the way too and decided to add some of the stalk whites to the powder.	102
5	1	68	1	When she came back, the Reverend had left and the man was covered and snoring away.  	85
5	1	68	2	His eyelashes long over large eyelids looked like a sleeping angel.  	69
5	1	68	3	His brassy hair shone in a gold from the setting sunlight.  	60
5	1	68	4	His face was very pale.  	25
5	1	68	5	His coat was left on the chair. 	32
5	1	68	6	His pants were wadded on the floor.	35
5	1	69	1	“Mary, I should warn you.  	27
5	1	69	2	The work of a Physick is serious and sacred.  	46
5	1	69	3	You must not let your emotions come between you and someone’s life	66
5	1	69	4	.	1
5	1	69	5	 “	2
5	1	70	1	“Mother, you should know that … I’ve decided the same thing.”	61
5	1	71	1	“I don’t know about this poor gentleman.  	42
5	1	71	2	He seems to have a steady but weakened heart.”, sighed Judith.	62
5	1	72	1	“What do you know about him?” 	30
5	1	72	2	inquired Mary.	14
5	1	73	1	“He’s a captain.  	18
5	1	73	2	He’s only recently come here.”	30
5	1	74	1	The next day, Mary made breakfast of pork, eggs and bread and some milk to wash it down.  	90
5	1	74	2	As she strode across the room with the food on a board, she sees him, sitting up and awake.	91
5	1	75	1	“Well, you are looking better today.”	37
5	1	76	1	He grabbed some of the bread and ate it quickly and swallowed down the milk.  	78
5	1	76	2	“I’m sorry Miss Perkins, but I am famished.”	44
5	1	77	1	“I have to check your bandages ….Captain.”	42
5	1	78	1	“Captain Bradbury….   	22
5	1	78	2	But you can call me Thomas if you’re going to do that.”	55
5	1	79	1	Mary blushed red.  	19
5	1	79	2	As she uncovered him, she could see that the blood did not let up much and that he’d need to get his outer wrappings replaced to keep it enskinned. 	148
5	1	79	3	She couldn’t help but notice that he had a very large engorged penis and droopy balls.  	88
5	1	79	4	He seemed to blush.	19
5	1	80	1	“There’s nothing wrong with that.  	35
5	1	80	2	I just have to relieve myself.”	31
5	1	81	1	Mary brought over a pot, quietly and trying to to express anything.  	69
5	1	81	2	She went away and came back to empty it out.  	46
5	1	81	3	She went to work again on his bandage.  	40
5	1	81	4	There again, his manhood stood at full mast and it brushed her arm. 	68
5	1	81	5	She pulled back.  	18
5	1	81	6	“It’s just morning. 	20
5	1	81	7	I’m sorry.”  	13
5	1	81	8	Mary felt bizarre but then went back to changing his outer bandage.  	69
5	1	81	9	She was kind and gentle as possible in her mind.  	50
5	1	81	10	Judith was busy tending Lydia.  	32
5	1	81	11	Her thoughts deep down were bouncing around underneath a calm and gentle exterior.	82
5	1	82	1	“Are you thirsty Captain?”	26
5	1	83	1	“Yes Miss.”	11
5	1	84	1	She went to get him some tea.  	31
5	1	84	2	He sipped it slowly.  	22
5	1	84	3	She sat quietly, waiting on him.  	34
5	1	84	4	Cooking and washing and occasionally seeing Judith and Lydia wander in.	71
5	1	85	1	Mary focused on her work all day, washing, cleaning, milking, churning and gathering medicines.  	97
5	1	85	2	She would check on Captain Bradbury, finding him asleep. 	57
5	1	85	3	As darkness came, she tucked herself in bed, keeping an eye on him and exhausted, fell deep into sleep.  	105
5	1	85	4	In her sleep, she slid around in her bed, restless, yearning.  	63
5	1	85	5	She gently moaned in her sleep as she dreamt of him, embracing her, touching her face, she dreamt of him naked and imagining herself inspecting him closely, admiring his build.  	178
5	1	85	6	She saw herself naked with him rubbing against him and eventually pulled into herself dreaming of his large manhood entering her gently, slowly, ecstatically and building into a rhythmic and steady lift and tightly clutched embrace.  	234
5	1	85	7	Her body ached for his love.  	30
5	1	85	8	She ached to feel the breeze of warmth from his lips against her ear, telling her things that she mixed from her past romance on board.  	137
5	1	85	9	Just knowing he was a captain made her feel that much more love struck and obsessed with him.  	95
5	1	85	10	His image pressed into her mind as she imagined his body pressing into hers.  	78
5	1	85	11	She woke up in a slick which she slid her soft legs around in. 	63
5	1	85	12	She held a pillow tightly and waking, she was in a blush and daze of imagined sex and embarrassment, confusion, pride and thrill. 	130
5	1	85	13	He humbled her and she loved it. 	33
5	1	85	14	Her whole person was fluttering about the home that morning.  	62
5	1	85	15	Judith noticed and went into quandary.  	40
5	1	85	16	She was worried she might be hurt again. 	41
5	1	85	17	She wanted Mary to have a fair chance at having real suitors.  	63
5	1	85	18	Judith felt a bit ashamed of herself.  	39
5	1	85	19	She did not wait until marriage before she had been broken into love. 	70
5	1	85	20	She wasn’t sure she could tell Mary how to conduct herself without coming off as hypocritical. 	95
5	1	85	21	Judith did seek in her mind however to put Mary back into sensibility and that night, she wrote back some of her earlier suitors and decided to have a talk with Mary.	166
5	1	86	1	“You’re going to have company soon and I want you to bathe yourself.  	70
5	1	86	2	I will take over from here for your nursing.”	45
5	1	87	1	That day, as Judith tended Captain Bradbury, he told Judith how beautiful he was but that he was still deeply sad.  	116
5	1	87	2	He told Judith how much she and Mary looked alike and Judith had to blush, only remembering how gray she was when she last looked.  	132
5	1	87	3	He asked when she would be back, what she was doing.  	54
5	1	87	4	Judith could tell, he was in love too.  	40
5	1	87	5	It broke her heart to do what she did at this point.  	54
5	1	87	6	She decided then and there to let love take its course but to only get involved when she had to.  	98
5	1	87	7	Judith did not sense hostility in Thomas.  	43
5	1	87	8	He was a real gentleman and not cheap either.	45
5	1	88	1	Later that day, the Reverend popped in again.	45
5	1	89	1	“Goodwife Perkins, thank you for your care of the sick.  	57
5	1	89	2	Blessings upon your home for this work.  	41
5	1	89	3	I know the Lord delights in the care of others and your diligence.  	68
5	1	89	4	Gentleman Bradbury here is not just an agent but a noble man who is the great nephew of Sir Gorges.  	101
5	1	89	5	He has agreed to pay you fifty pounds.”	39
5	1	90	1	Judith’s jaw dropped.  	23
5	1	90	2	It was more than she had ever accepted for this work.  	55
5	1	90	3	She felt guilty and refused it three times.  	45
5	1	90	4	Captain Bradbury spoke up.	26
5	1	91	1	“I must insist or I will forever feel ungrateful to you and this would break my heart.  	88
5	1	91	2	You wouldn’t do that would you?”	32
5	1	92	1	Judith couldn’t refuse at that point and took a handful of silver coins and a note for the rest. 	97
5	1	92	2	This was rare indeed since most of the time she was offered tobacco which she had to resell.  	94
5	1	92	3	Beaver skins, sheep, goats and pigs were nice when she could receive those but this was raw and simple remuneration which she could immediately take to trade and buy whatever she wished.  	188
5	1	92	4	Keeping her goldlust in check, she humbly thanked him and proceeded to serve supper and ale to them.	100
5	1	93	1	Judith cared for the Captain this way for several days, taking turns with Mary whenever Mary went out.  	104
5	1	93	2	While Mary sometimes showed she was enjoying herself.  	55
5	1	93	3	She would wake up thinking of Thomas.	37
5	1	94	1	One night, when Mary came in, Captain Thomas was wakeful and wearing new breeches and asked Mary, “How was your day today?  	124
5	1	94	2	I miss your tender care.”	25
5	1	95	1	“It was fine, I had a lot of fun.  	35
5	1	95	2	Oh, I’m sorry, I really don’t want to go on about it seeing how you are.  	74
5	1	95	3	Please don’t ask me.”	21
5	1	96	1	“But I love to see you happy.  	31
5	1	96	2	I wish there was something more I could do to make you smile even more.  	73
5	1	96	3	Are you happy?”	15
5	1	97	1	“Yes, I believe so.  	21
5	1	97	2	I wish I could be here more but they … Must I say this.  “, she sighed, “I cannot fraternize with my patients.”	111
5	1	98	1	Captain Thomas’ face showed a sudden despair but then lightened again.	70
5	1	99	1	“Well, if you help me up, I won’t fraternize with you.  	56
5	1	99	2	I just want to see you since you...helped me so many times, feel hope, joy again.  	83
5	1	99	3	I haven’t been able to feel my leg but I want to try and walk.”	63
5	1	100	1	Mary moved over to him to help him up.  	40
5	1	100	2	He held onto her.  	19
5	1	100	3	For a moment, the passion caught them both.  	45
5	1	100	4	He steadied himself but embraced her thigh to thigh and breast to breast. 	74
5	1	100	5	She felt how warm he was.  	27
5	1	100	6	He felt softer but muscled in an almost familiar way.  	55
5	1	100	7	She felt his intimate touch again against her and her mind flashed back to her dream.  	87
5	1	100	8	He noticed she couldn’t pull away so he stumbled a little to break the embrace.  	81
5	1	100	9	He blushed brightly to where she could see it.  	48
5	1	100	10	She could tell now that he was feeling for her.	47
5	1	101	1	She fought herself in her mind.  	33
5	1	101	2	Frustrated in her heart like a dove amongst the thorns.	55
5	1	102	1	She helped him take a few steps towards the chair so he could catch on.  	73
5	1	102	2	He was stronger now but still heavy even though he was not as tall or broad as the man she would never speak of anymore.  	122
5	1	102	3	Captain Thomas was not heavyweight, just dense with muscles that felt like a sack of cannonballs.  	99
5	1	102	4	He had finally made it.  	25
5	1	102	5	She smiled tearfully for him and they laughed together.  	57
5	1	102	6	Captain Thomas was very happy to have made progress.	52
5	1	103	1	“Well, I should be back to my old self in no time!”	51
5	1	104	1	The next day, a suitor arrived at the door to pick Mary up.  	61
5	1	104	2	Judith reluctantly set her out.  	33
5	1	104	3	That morning, Thomas didn’t wake up.  	38
5	1	104	4	He was dry and hot.  	21
5	1	104	5	He was getting a fever and becoming drowsy and incoherent.  	60
5	1	104	6	Judith had to help him bring it down.  	39
5	1	104	7	The weather was only getting warmer so Judith went to find snow and cold water.  	81
5	1	104	8	She got some slippery elm and gave it to him.  	47
5	1	104	9	Fortunately, his bleeding had long stopped. 	44
5	1	104	10	John Sr had come back from patrolling and training with his troop of men trying to defend the outposts against attacks and raids.  	131
5	1	104	11	Judith talked with him in hushed tones about her concern.	57
5	1	105	1	When Mary came home, she saw him there, sleeping, extra blankets piled on and shivering.  	90
5	1	105	2	She got mother.  	17
5	1	105	3	“What’s wrong with him?”	24
5	1	106	1	“He’s come down with a fever Mary.”	35
5	1	107	1	The next day, Captain Thomas laid still in his be and as father went back out to patrol,  Judith looked at Mary’s eyes and noticed there were tears streaming.  	160
5	1	107	2	He wasn’t drinking or eating like he used to. 	46
5	1	107	3	“He might have a bad air and might have to go to the pest house.  	66
5	1	107	4	This is not good news for us.” 	31
5	1	107	5	Judith left the room to tend to Lydia.	38
5	1	108	1	Mary felt this might be something else.  	41
5	1	108	2	She got a cloth soaked in cool water and laid it all over him.  	64
5	1	108	3	She bared his chest and put it on his chest which she had not seen before.  	76
5	1	108	4	It was beautifully shaped with light tufts but he was looking thinner and ribbed.  	83
5	1	108	5	She started to sob and laid her face over his bare chest. 	58
5	1	108	6	“I can’t lose you.  	20
5	1	108	7	I don’t want payment.  	23
5	1	108	8	I’d give you everything I had if you would just come back.”  	61
5	1	108	9	She noticed he was not responding other than an occasional sleepy moan.  	73
5	1	108	10	She sobbed more.  	18
5	1	108	11	Judith peeked out at them, feeling an instinct to break up this violation of her protocols but instead forbeared of it.	119
5	1	109	1	Mary’s sobbing stopped and she composed herself, sniffling repeatedly until her face was dry.  	95
5	1	109	2	Her lips were cracked.  	24
5	1	109	3	Her eyes red.  	15
5	1	109	4	Then she said it. 	18
5	1	109	5	“I… I… I have to say it. 	25
5	1	109	6	I can’t take it any longer.  	29
5	1	109	7	I, I am sorely afraid.  	24
5	1	109	8	I did this to you.  	20
5	1	109	9	I’m most miserable about it.  	30
5	1	109	10	More than ever….”, a sudden dejavous of Waylon came up.  	57
5	1	109	11	This was worst.  	17
5	1	109	12	With Waylon, it was a surprise, a sudden shock, it was over then she mourned.  	79
5	1	109	13	This was waiting to mourn.  	28
5	1	109	14	It was harder, more difficult and worst of all, she had held back so much more of her feelings for him.  	105
5	1	109	15	After everything that happened in the short weeks together.  	61
5	1	109	16	This was her greatest fear coming true all over again.  	56
5	1	109	17	She fought back more tears.  	29
5	1	109	18	“I wish...we could be together.  	33
5	1	109	19	You have to know the truth.”, she paused and then said forcefully, seriously and wholeheartedly, “I love you.”.  	113
5	1	109	20	The wave of sadness started to shake her.  	43
5	1	109	21	She could feel a breeze blowing through the window.  	53
5	1	109	22	Sunlight broke through the clouds again and shone on him.  	59
5	1	109	23	He smiled.	10
5	1	110	1	She heard Judith who to Mary might have just been feeling the breeze, sniffling but little did she know that Judith was touched by what she had just seen.  	156
5	1	110	2	Mary’s face went red and then white and she draped one blanket back over Captain Bradbury and grabbed a handful of hand tools for work.	135
5	1	111	1	That evening, Mary came in the room.  	38
5	1	111	2	Captain Bradbury was looking much better and awake and smiled.  	64
5	1	111	3	Mary blushed and went about making him food and being dutiful.	62
5	1	112	1	The next morning, the Reverend came by to check on him.  	57
5	1	112	2	Captain Bradbury had woke up in a sweat and Judith had served him breakfast, checked on his now scabby leg and gave him a new bandage.  	136
5	1	112	3	Mary slept in. 	15
5	1	112	4	He asked Judith to help him get up.  	37
5	1	112	5	Captain Bradbury’s strength had come back even more than he himself had realized and he stood straight up and took one step, then another as easily as if he had just woke up with nothing of any trouble at all.	209
5	1	113	1	The Reverend looked on, joyfully and in shock and enthusiastically declared, “Praise God, Bless you Goodwife Perkins and bless Miss Mary Perkins for your miracle work.  	169
5	1	113	2	You are truly the balm of peace and healing in God’s own hands.”	64
5	1	114	1	Judith humbly smiles. 	22
5	1	114	2	“Praise God and blessings upon you Good Reverend and pastor of the flock.  	75
5	1	114	3	Without you, we would all have been lost.”	42
5	1	115	1	The reverend smiled at this and Judith decided not to let this turn into a gushy exchange, so with that Judith left the room handing Captain Thomas his breeches and shirt to replace his gown with.	196
5	1	116	1	“Mary’s sleeping but I’ll let her know.”	40
5	1	117	1	After being called back, they said goodbyes and Captain Bradbury and the Reverend had left and given her a remaining payment.  	127
5	1	117	2	Judith watched their profiles shrink into the horizon as they left waving cordially.  	86
5	1	117	3	Judith smiled to herself, happy that he had recovered and also hopeful he would return for her daughter.  	106
5	1	117	4	She went to her own box and pulled some florals together and made Mary a homemade perfume out of rose, violet, lilac and honeysuckle dampening it with acorn nut oil and the tiniest pinch of cloves.  	199
5	1	117	5	When she was finishing, Mary stumbled around yawning and finding her way to the front room where her patient lay.  	115
5	1	117	6	She turned around and saw Judith there working.	47
5	1	118	1	“Where is he?”	14
5	1	119	1	“He recovered.  	16
5	1	119	2	I don’t know what you did but maybe the fever ran its course and he appears to have broken the fever and found his old strength again.”	135
5	1	120	1	Mary gave a somber glance back at her.	38
5	1	121	1	“More wounded will come Mary. 	30
5	1	121	2	You did a wonderful thing for him.”	35
5	1	122	1	“Will he come back?”	20
5	1	123	1	“He didn’t say anything.  	26
5	1	123	2	He left me with enough money however to buy a second team and cart and maybe a new barn.”	89
5	1	125	1	Salem was bustling town. 	25
5	1	125	2	John Endicott’s estate had a couple gables, two stories and finely cut timbers. 	80
5	1	125	3	Inside, his wife Elizabeth was cradling her newborn baby boy. 	62
5	1	125	4	John was looking through his curtains at the approach of George Carr. 	70
5	1	125	5	After George had been seated, they got down to business.	56
5	1	126	1	“George, the villagers everywhere tell me what a fine craftsman you are.”	73
5	1	127	1	“I just give them what they ask of me, God willing.”	52
5	1	128	1	“I would like to commission a small project for you.”	53
5	1	129	1	“What are your terms?”	22
5	1	130	1	“We’ll get to that in a bit.  	30
5	1	130	2	First I want to ask you how you’re able to fend off all those ladies after you. 	80
5	1	130	3	Have you chosen a girl to suit you yet?”	40
5	1	131	1	“I’m still getting over the last one I chose Sir.”	50
5	1	132	1	“Who was she? 	14
5	1	132	2	She would have to be a very foolish girl to lose a man like you.”	65
5	1	133	1	“Miss Mary Bradbury.”	21
5	1	134	1	John Endicott’s mouth dropped a little and his head stirred a bit.	66
5	1	135	1	“She’s a real beauty and a good midwife if I may say so. 	57
5	1	135	2	A little absent minded but she didn’t seem like the foolish type.”	66
5	1	136	1	“Oh, she’s really something else. 	34
5	1	136	2	Her parents and friends kept getting in the way of us. 	55
5	1	136	3	The gossips. 	13
5	1	136	4	Can’t trust ‘em. 	17
5	1	136	5	I also think Mary’s mother is a witch.  	40
5	1	136	6	What’s worse, I think Mary is following in those footsteps.”	60
5	1	137	1	“Who were these friends? 	25
5	1	137	2	I hope not those Hutchinson congregants.”	41
5	1	138	1	“Well, it’s even worse. 	24
5	1	138	2	She is friends with Margaret Jones. 	36
5	1	138	3	Margaret was probably the secret love affair of Thomas Morton when he landed here.”	83
5	1	139	1	John Endicott’s face waxed pensive as if flooded by memories, his smile weighed by them, he went into a scowl of ferocity.	122
5	1	140	1	“I should have never let her in this house. 	44
5	1	140	2	You should really be proud of yourself letting that one go. 	60
5	1	140	3	Thomas Morton was criminal of complete moral abandonment. 	58
5	1	140	4	I detest him more than I do all the papacy of our motherland. 	62
5	1	140	5	He was a most grievous man to have to endure the debaucheries and scandals of. 	79
5	1	140	6	He was a witch of the worst kind too.”	38
5	1	141	1	“I know it.”	12
5	1	142	1	“There are many eligible girls in Salem. 	41
5	1	142	2	You would be well favoured to pick one of them. 	48
5	1	142	3	Stay clear of the odd ones George and you’ll do fine.”	54
5	1	143	1	“I appreciate your guidance Sir.”	33
5	1	144	1	“Let’s go over these terms of yours after a good meal. 	55
5	1	144	2	I’m sure you’re starved having to go over all that. 	52
5	1	144	3	Chin up, you will find a suitable wife in due time. 	52
5	1	144	4	After this project, I know you will. 	37
5	1	144	5	I need a vessel to cross the North River. 	42
5	1	144	6	With more mouths to feed, I need to expand.”	44
5	2	1	1	At the Perkins home in Ipswich, a wounded lady showed up.  	59
5	2	1	2	She had a sore head injury that was unusual and unseen before.  	64
5	2	1	3	Mary spent time working but her heart wasn’t into it.  	55
5	2	1	4	Judith noticing her lack of improvement took over for her.  	60
5	2	1	5	Mary decided to run errands and buy more supplies but in her heart, she knew she was really looking for Captain Bradbury.	121
5	2	2	1	As she was about, she saw George, with an entourage of other men loitering and watching the ladies enter and leave.  	117
5	2	2	2	George caught a glimpse of Mary who wasn’t looking at him at that time.  	73
5	2	2	3	Mary casually moved out of his view and made a dash in hopes of losing him.  	77
5	2	2	4	She went to the fields to forage for berries for a few hours and then went back to the store, checking to see if they had left.  	129
5	2	2	5	She took her time with the traders, watching, making a lot of choices and changing her mind.	92
5	2	3	1	“You, lady, sure are a fickle one.  	36
5	2	3	2	Would you tell me now, is it the white cloth or the blue one?”	62
5	2	4	1	“I need to see if I can get the white cloth but if not, I’ll get the blue one, excuse me a moment while I count my coins.”	122
5	2	5	1	“You have coins?  	18
5	2	5	2	Trust me, you’ll get whatever you want for a few shillings.”	60
5	2	6	1	“But I may only have a few pence, please be patient with me Good Sirs, go about your business while I check my purse.”	118
5	2	7	1	She left with the white cloth...the one she wanted all along.  	63
5	2	7	2	She walked around the green as cautiously as she could being careful to avoid George’s path.   	95
5	2	7	3	Horses and carts came and went.  	33
5	2	7	4	It was a busy day but there was no sign of Captain Bradbury.  	62
5	2	7	5	She dared not leave the safety of the village since there was much more danger.  	81
5	2	7	6	She felt despondent that should could not venture out further without getting into serious trouble with father at home, let alone mother!	137
5	2	8	1	Losing hope, she walks back.  	30
5	2	8	2	Behind her back, Captain Bradbury exited his coach and into the store she was just inside.	90
5	2	9	1	The days were rainy and warmer.  	33
5	2	9	2	Mary went out every day after chores to conduct some business away.  	69
5	2	9	3	She even offered to go out to the water side to pick clams which was somewhat dangerous since there were more encounters with the “savages” there.  	148
5	2	9	4	While she knew there was a real danger, she was not fond of hearing them referred to as “savages”.   	101
5	2	9	5	While she was picking clams, she had picked enough bushels to make stew for weeks using the milk and butter she had back home.  	128
5	2	9	6	The patients she had loved them.	32
5	2	10	1	Mary was starting to think the Captain was probably dating other ladies.  	74
5	2	10	2	Not many were as familiar with him as he was a newcomer and also an agent.  	76
5	2	10	3	They just heard he was given a lot of land by his great uncle in a place they were calling Colchester but which had a more native name to the indian tribes.	156
5	2	11	1	Another day, they had a knock at the door.  	44
5	2	11	2	Mary hoped it would be Thomas somehow, she could hear a young man’s voice.  	76
5	2	11	3	This man had an entire leg amputated and bleeding.  	52
5	2	11	4	Mary tied a band around his leg as he was deliriously being held up by one other strong man.   	95
5	2	11	5	Mary tried to get him to lay down.  	36
5	2	11	6	His limbs just doubled and collapsed as they let go of an arm to the point that same man had to rush to break his fall.  	121
5	2	11	7	His heartbeat was weak and his face pale blue. 	47
5	2	11	8	His breathing was weak.  	25
5	2	11	9	He eventually stopped, his heart fading and his body grew cold and lifeless.  	78
5	2	11	10	He looked like she felt inside.  	33
5	2	11	11	It was bad timing.  	20
5	2	11	12	She couldn’t help but think back of Henry and others she had seen pass away.  	78
5	2	11	13	They all shook their heads.  	29
5	2	11	14	The strong man bowed his head in prayer as the others followed.	63
5	2	12	1	“May this son of yours have his soul carried away to thy paradise in heaven Our Dear Lord. 	91
5	2	12	2	May his family find comfort…”	29
5	2	13	1	The prayer continued sorrowfully on and became mourning.  	58
5	2	13	2	His family would have to receive notice of his passing that same day.  	71
5	2	13	3	They covered his face with his hat and took him to the burial ground and called his family to meet them there.  	112
5	2	13	4	He was buried without a box and given a stone that his father inscribed on with a mason’s chisel.	97
5	2	14	1	Several more men arrived that week.  	37
5	2	14	2	One of them drowned.  	22
5	2	14	3	Also hopeless.  	16
5	2	14	4	His wife had followed him wailing for him.  	44
5	2	14	5	Mary’s success seemed to have been diluted by so many hopeless cases that she barely felt the same zeal and confidence to heal that she had before.  	149
5	2	14	6	She was starting to realize that her own broken heart was teaching her this lesson.  	85
5	2	14	7	It sapped her intuition, strength, love for her work.  	55
5	2	14	8	She was realizing more with each passing day how much she really did love Captain Bradbury.  	93
5	2	14	9	She prayed for his return.  	28
5	2	14	10	She wore mother’s perfume every day and set charms about to call him back.	74
5	2	15	1	“He’s not going to come back to visit, is he, mother.”	54
5	2	16	1	“Don’t give up on love so easily as we do for the living who are already dead.”	79
5	2	17	1	This was the first time Mary heard Judith acknowledge it as such but they had both known by now that the other knew about Mary’s love.  	136
5	2	17	2	No words were needed.  	23
5	2	17	3	Their intuition told them enough strongly enough by their very motions.	71
5	2	18	1	Mary left to put on clam chowder on the fire in her cauldron.	61
5	2	19	1	Knock knock knock.	18
5	2	20	1	Mary just about dropped her spoon.  	36
5	2	20	2	She didn’t want to really mean what she had just said a few moments before.	75
5	2	21	1	Mary walked cautiously towards the door.  	42
5	2	21	2	Judith signaled to Mary to stay put by the fire and that she would get it.  	76
5	2	21	3	Judith took Lydia in one tired arm. 	36
5	2	21	4	Lydia had decided to wet her diaper-cloth right then and there.  	65
5	2	21	5	Judith groaned in disbelief.  	30
5	2	21	6	Picking up her own apron, she held it up under her daughter already becoming quite heavy.  	91
5	2	21	7	Lydia was a bit late in her training there.  	45
5	2	21	8	Judith finally reached the door and pulled it open.  	53
5	2	21	9	John Sr. could be heard out back sawing wood and nailing.  	59
5	2	21	10	Thomas and Jacob were playing loudly.  	39
5	2	21	11	There stood Captain Bradbury.	29
5	2	22	1	“Madam.”	8
5	2	23	1	“Captain, what a nice surprise to see you again.”, said Judith stealthily. 	75
5	2	23	2	“You’re looking magnificent!”.  	32
5	2	23	3	Captain Bradbury was dressed very nicely.  	43
5	2	23	4	He paused a little. 	20
5	2	23	5	“I’m not here as a patient now.”	32
5	2	24	1	“I’ve finally got myself to my work again.  	44
5	2	24	2	My hands have been busy with a project.  	41
5	2	24	3	I have been working around home but I have a little shallop on the river on a dock and no one to adventure on it with.  	120
5	2	24	4	I’m an orphan son you know, just hoping to make a few good friends.   	70
5	2	24	5	But who better to invite than a friend who cared for me when I was in my direst need.”	86
5	2	25	1	Judith saw through his wordy banter and nodded quickly to move him along.	73
5	2	26	1	“I would like to treat Mary to a ride on my little craft.” said Captain Thomas not knowing the more devious subtlety in his speech.	131
5	2	27	1	“Mary has chores to finish, but after that she’ll be ready.”	60
5	2	28	1	“Mother? 	9
5	2	28	2	I can finish all those later..”	31
5	2	29	1	“Oh go on, be back before dark kids.”, she teased, smirking.  	62
5	2	29	2	“And do you have an escort young man?”	38
5	2	30	1	“I do madam, I am bringing with me some help who have agreed to help me steer and float my shallop over the river.  	116
5	2	30	2	I would be taking her on a tour.”	33
5	2	31	1	Mary’s eyes lit up and she was leaving the room and came back in a pretty skirt ruffled out in such little time, Judith had wondered if Mary had pulled something unusual out of her usual bag of tricks.	201
5	2	32	1	Mary gave Judith a hug, thinking she might have caused this auspicious event to happen.	87
5	2	33	1	Judith broke the mood a little with “Wouldn’t you like to stay for a supper first? 	83
5	2	33	2	Mary, your clam chowder is boiling to a froth, put out the fire would you?”	75
5	2	34	1	Mary forgetting that she did in fact have a cooking chore in progress settled back into serving supper, in her pretty blue dress, looking a bit awkward as she did.	163
5	2	35	1	Captain Thomas wore a deep blue captain’s coat with brassy adornments, buttons and embellishments.	98
5	2	36	1	Judith pulled some cooling bread off a breadboard next to the hearth as Mary ladled soup into thick glazed clay bowls.	118
5	2	37	1	Captain Thomas ate more daintily than either of them had remembered.  	70
5	2	37	2	Mary and Judith passed gleams and smiles as they admired his polished look, his strong set jaw and brassy brown hair.  	119
5	2	37	3	A pink colors was back in his cheeks and face.  	48
5	2	37	4	He looked happy and contented himself.  	40
5	2	37	5	John Sr and her brothers came in.  	35
5	2	37	6	“I smell food!”	15
5	2	38	1	“You smell a diaper.”, came Judith’s wit, so quick as to make Captain Bradbury hold back his soup and gasp through his nose.  	126
5	2	38	2	He held his hand over his face and smiled, chuckling breaking up some of the stiffness in his dress.	100
5	2	39	1	“Judy, you’re going to have to let me make soup for you some time then.”, winked John Sr.	89
5	2	40	1	Both of them had decades of practice with their own banter.  	61
5	2	40	2	Mary knew all the retorts that would come next between the two of them to the point her response was less mirthful but no one seemed to notice it.	146
5	2	41	1	After cleaning up a couple bowls of soup, Captain Bradbury said, “Your family, is most remarkable in your hospitality.  	120
5	2	41	2	You have done well for yourself Sergeant Perkins.”	50
5	2	42	1	John Sr. smiled wryly and blinked at the flattery and gave a modest “Thank you for saying so.  	95
5	2	42	2	We work hard and that’s all we claim here.”	43
5	2	43	1	“You sound like a man of good letters and proper speech.  	58
5	2	43	2	Are you a writer?”	18
5	2	44	1	“I am a clerk if that counts as a writer.”	42
5	2	45	1	“Oh yes indeed Sir, not everyone gets to perform that duty without some knowledge of the most formal of letters.  	114
5	2	45	2	I would look to you for guidance there.  	41
5	2	45	3	I have a love of learning myself.  	35
5	2	45	4	My grandmother ran a dame school. ”	35
5	2	46	1	“We have, in all truth, done the same, how remarkable a similarity there.  	75
5	2	46	2	We feel it is everyone’s right to know proper speech and the writing that the speech has come from so we can all do well and good no matter wherever English folk may be.  	171
5	2	46	3	Mary here even enjoys studying some Latin from the great antiquities.” replied John	83
5	2	47	1	“Is that so Sergeant Perkins, you are a family of great diligence, learning and culture and that is better than all wealth to me.  	131
5	2	47	2	Such wealth is heavenly wealth to me.  	39
5	2	47	3	God is a God of truth after all.  	34
5	2	47	4	How do you find the time to become such great hosts and such scholars in this adventurous place?  	98
5	2	47	5	Do not feel obliged Good Sir.  	31
5	2	47	6	I am relishing this soup.  	27
5	2	47	7	I can see how Mary’s reputation is well deserved in medicine but I never knew should could cook to a man’s delight.”	116
5	2	48	1	Mary could see they were done and got up to clear the table.  	62
5	2	48	2	Judith sat Mary down and ask the boys to do this chore as Mary was in her nice clothes.  	89
5	2	48	3	They got up and Thomas gave a heartfelt handshake to John Sr.  	63
5	2	48	4	“So joyous an occasion to see you all again. 	45
5	2	48	5	Blessings upon you. 	20
5	2	48	6	We’ll be back before dusk.” said Thomas.  	42
5	2	48	7	His loquacious words seemingly came from a place of sincerity.	62
5	2	49	1	Captain Thomas took Mary’s hand and they rode his coach out to his dock.   	75
5	2	49	2	Captain Thomas put his arm around Mary in a genteel caring manner as if to repay her for her caring demeanor.  	111
5	2	49	3	Mary smiled at him, failing to be modest about her feelings but trying again she looked out, occasionally peeking at his beautiful visage and romanticizing their time together.	176
5	2	50	1	Captain Thomas’s dock was not far from the beach.  	51
5	2	50	2	The water was gently waving. 	29
5	2	50	3	He took her by the hand and gave her seat on board.  	53
5	2	50	4	The little barge was new and built with care.  	47
5	2	50	5	After he untied the shallop, he ran and leapt aboard, using an oar and a staff to take them out to sea.	103
5	2	51	1	“Mary, I heard you.  	21
5	2	51	2	I know I heard you say that you love me.  	42
5	2	51	3	It has pounded on my head every day since I left and those words, are unusual to me.  	86
5	2	51	4	But then I realized something.  	32
5	2	51	5	I can’t describe it other than that it consumes all that has ever been said on love.  	86
5	2	51	6	I was surprised.  	18
5	2	51	7	I didn’t know you felt….the same as I did...which can only mean one thing.  	76
5	2	51	8	I know, that I have also, this whole time, fallen completely in love with you.  	80
5	2	51	9	I love you Mary.  	18
5	2	51	10	I knew it wasn’t anything else.  	33
5	2	51	11	At first I didn’t know if it was my shock or medicines making me see angels, but those things went away but the angel that was you still stood there. 	150
5	2	51	12	Do you, still love me?”	23
5	2	52	1	Mary looked into his eyes, tearful, smiling. 	45
5	2	52	2	“Of course. 	12
5	2	52	3	I could never take that back.”	30
5	2	53	1	“Can I see you again?”	22
5	2	54	1	“Yes.”, she nodded smiling, coyly.	34
5	2	55	1	He looked into her eyes and reached to hold her hand.  	55
5	2	55	2	Another hand gently to her arm and then softly to the back.  	61
5	2	55	3	He leaned close as she closed her eyes slightly and stilled herself to be taken by his kiss.  	94
5	2	55	4	Nothing doubting, she felt him embrace her, touching her lips with his and holding there. 	90
5	2	55	5	It was a thrill of electricity and the warmth of love passionately overtaking her.  	84
5	2	55	6	Breathing slowly and deeply she held onto him as their warm kiss opened into a caressing one of the mouth. 	107
5	2	55	7	It felt almost like the sex itself she had in dreams. 	54
5	2	55	8	Her passion opened into thoughts of her love for him extending to the day she might be his, forever.	100
5	2	56	1	They broke at the same time, their minds carefree but in unison, as if one in mind. 	84
5	2	56	2	He held his man-sized gentle fingers to her face and brushed her cheeks gently with fingers that felt softer than they looked. 	127
5	2	56	3	His touch was so gentle for being so firm in build.  	53
5	2	56	4	She hadn’t noticed the tears on her cheeks.  	45
5	2	56	5	It was the most wonderful feeling.  	36
5	2	56	6	The salty breeze of the ocean blew around them, warm and friendly.  	68
5	2	56	7	The sun was setting over the hills in the distance with a majestic gown of purples and oranges and magentas streaming over the vast expanse above.  	148
5	2	56	8	The shallop drifted calmly.  	29
5	2	56	9	The sun still to touch the horizon, he quietly but dutifully oared to shore and took Mary home before it would set.  	117
5	2	56	10	The sun had just disappeared below the horizon as they pulled up.  	67
5	2	56	11	The sky had grown into a soft kaleidoscope of pastelled hues set in the fading blue sky.	88
5	2	57	1	Mary was overwhelmed with joy. 	31
5	2	57	2	She slept but awoke again to thoughts of him. 	46
5	2	57	3	Her loneliness ached and she sought to see him again.	53
5	2	58	1	That Friday, he came back for her and they sat around her home.  	65
5	2	58	2	He was helping her around the house.  	38
5	2	58	3	Late in the evening, they chatted around Mary’s fire.	53
5	2	59	1	“Do you have any stories about your youth Captain Bradbury?”	60
5	2	60	1	“Just a few.  	14
5	2	60	2	My father raised me until I was old enough to work.  	53
5	2	60	3	I went to school until they had nothing left for me to read.  	62
5	2	60	4	My mother passed away when I was two. 	38
5	2	60	5	My uncle was the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Whitgift, my mother’s brother.  	80
5	2	60	6	He loved reading and read Latin to me but I never quite picked it up.  	71
5	2	60	7	I learned a few quips here and there.  	39
5	2	60	8	He gave books to me as a child, sad that his sister had passed so early after my birth.  	89
5	2	60	9	You know, he taught a lot of famous people including Sir Francis Bacon, the Viscount of St. 	92
5	2	60	10	Alban.  	8
5	2	60	11	He tutored him and his brother Andrew.  	40
5	2	60	12	Of course Francis Bacon is quite the man of the court with his brilliant mind.  	80
5	2	60	13	You probably already know my great uncle, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Knight of the province of Maine, sent me.  	108
5	2	60	14	Actually, he’s adopted me by his marriage to my aunt Anne, Lady Anne Bell. ”	76
5	2	61	1	“How unusual.  	15
5	2	61	2	Hold it there Tom.  	20
5	2	61	3	Did you say the ‘Viscount of St. 	33
5	2	61	4	Alban’?”	8
5	2	62	1	“Yes, why?”	11
5	2	63	1	“He gave me a book when my brother Henry died when I was a young girl, just before we came over here.  	103
5	2	63	2	I used to live in HIlmorton...and...that would explain what the initials F.B. are.  	84
5	2	63	3	All this time, I had no clue.  	31
5	2	63	4	I’ve heard of him but I didn’t know he visited me!”	51
5	2	64	1	“Hilmorton is where Count Bacon’s family was from.”	51
5	2	65	1	“Then I’m sure of it.  	23
5	2	65	2	You wouldn’t know why he might give someone a box they couldn’t open would you?”	80
5	2	66	1	“I have no idea.  	18
5	2	66	2	He’s eccentric.  	17
5	2	66	3	You never know what he might do next.”	38
5	2	67	1	“And you said something about Ferdinando Gorges.  	50
5	2	67	2	You wouldn’t know a Thomas Morton would you?”	45
5	2	68	1	“I know of him.  	17
5	2	68	2	He’s part of that educated thespian circle with William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon.  	88
5	2	68	3	They are all good friends.  	28
5	2	68	4	I’ve been to drinking parties with them, back when my foolishness was at it’s peak.  	85
5	2	68	5	I would see him at school or visiting.  	40
5	2	68	6	It’s sad what’s happened to him but I have to stay quiet on the matter.  	73
5	2	68	7	I’ve been given a good deal of land to take care of and we don’t want the likes of those in Boston taking it away.”	115
5	2	69	1	“My best friend Margaret Jones was friends with Thomas Morton.”	63
5	2	70	1	“They can be an odd bunch.  	28
5	2	70	2	Francis Bacon is very secretive in his writings of plays and of his novels.  	77
5	2	70	3	He’s considered one of the secret elders among those of the Order of the Rosy Cross.  	86
5	2	70	4	He knew it was a good piece of wool cover for the eyes of the uninitiated but Francis ran with the idea and actually formed a group.  	134
5	2	70	5	Thomas wanted to reform the church but found so many deaf ears that he started completely from scratch.  	105
5	2	70	6	He’s really a good man but an odd one.   	41
5	2	70	7	So is Thomas Browne who you might have heard of.  	50
5	2	70	8	He’s a very smart one too. 	27
5	2	70	9	Me, I’m just a humble captain trying to make my own way. 	57
5	2	70	10	I’m all alone here but that’s what I’m used to.”	48
5	2	71	1	“There’s so much I want to tell you Tom.”	41
5	2	72	1	“Then tell me after we get married.”, Thomas reached behind him and pulled out a silk cloth.	92
5	2	73	1	“Mary, will you marry me?”	26
5	2	74	1	“Yes..When do you choose?”	26
5	2	75	1	“This May.  	12
5	2	75	2	Then let’s swear it by fasting your hand to mine and sealing it what a kiss.. 	78
5	2	75	3	Do you have a clean kerchief or cloth?”  	41
5	2	75	4	Mary took a ribbon out of her hair.  	37
5	2	75	5	Thomas took out his kerchief.  	31
5	2	75	6	They kissed and exchanged the cloth items and wore them as bracelets.  	71
5	2	75	7	He took her hand in hand, arm in arm. 	38
5	2	75	8	Never speaking harshly.  	25
5	2	75	9	He reminded her of her father’s genteel nature and yet he also reminder her of Waylon who she still missed.	107
5	2	76	1	They waited a month and soon the day came when they got married before the Reverend with guests by invitation.  	112
5	2	76	2	The Captain made sure no one else interrupted or crashed the wedding.  	71
5	2	76	3	She wore a beautiful white veil, a long white wedding dress.  	62
5	2	76	4	He wore his uniform and scabbard with sword.  	46
5	2	76	5	The wedding flew by in the blink of an eye.	43
5	2	77	1	The organ breaks into majestically chorded love music as they walk hand in hand out the door.  	95
5	2	77	2	The flowers and apple blossoms were blooming, cherry blossoms could be seen strewing their own petals everywhere.  	115
5	2	77	3	Nature Herself blessed their union.	35
5	2	78	1	Mary gave final hugs to John Sr. and Judith and Elizabeth and William there. 	77
5	2	78	2	Elizabeth poked William in the ribs and as Mary threw her bouquet, Elizabeth caught it.  	89
5	2	78	3	While it seemed an ordinary wedding, it was blessed with the song of birds, the petals of blossoms and the happiness naturally filled the air.	142
5	2	79	1	Thomas helped Mary into his coach and they rode over the trails through the shady groves to his home.  	103
5	2	79	2	Thomas had help prepare a feast.  	34
5	2	79	3	He ordered them to leave kindly, paying them as they went out the door to which they bowed in gratitude.  	106
5	2	79	4	Thomas had lit candles as the sky grew dimmer.	46
5	2	80	1	Mary and Thomas knelt together on their wedding bed.  	54
5	2	80	2	Captain Bradbury was a meticulous planner and prepared every detail for this night. 	84
5	2	80	3	He took her into his arms and kissed her softly. 	49
5	2	80	4	While he was plenty strong, his gentleness reassured Mary that everything was going to be ok for her from here out.	115
5	2	81	1	She woke up to him, lying on his back, she trawled a soft warm finger across his chest.  	89
5	2	81	2	He shivered a little and opened his eyes.  	43
5	2	81	3	He smiled at her.  	19
5	2	81	4	His smile was clean and beautiful and showed his strong jaw.  	62
5	2	81	5	She smiled back at him looking at him lovingly.  	49
5	2	81	6	After more affectionate gazes and sweet nothings, they went about looking around his place.	91
5	2	82	1	Mary opened her chest and found that Judith have given her the little box among her books, she also had the vial Margaret gave her and a lot of other keepsakes for Michael her grandfather, and Henry, her deceased brother.	221
5	2	83	1	“Tom, I have something to show you.”, she pulled out the box with the crest.	76
5	2	84	1	Tom’s eyes widened and he stuttered at first: “So you, you and your mother are, part of his Order?”	99
5	2	85	1	Mary answered curious herself, “I guess so.  	45
5	2	85	2	I don’t really know what that is.  	35
5	2	85	3	I didn’t know he was Francis Bacon until you told me.”	54
5	2	86	1	Thomas pointed at the box: “That’s is the Bacon family crest.  	63
5	2	86	2	What’s in it?”	14
5	2	87	1	Mary looked at it closer, “I can’t open it until the right time.  	66
5	2	87	2	It doesn’t sound like anything is in there. 	44
5	2	87	3	Maybe it’s another note.”	25
5	2	88	1	“You’re wise to not touch it unless you have to.  	50
5	2	88	2	What you have there is like Pandora’s Box. 	43
5	2	88	3	It can release great powers of protection or harm depending on how it’s used.  	79
5	2	88	4	don’t use it, unless you have to”, Tom repeated.	48
6	1	1	1	Mary was cleaning up the new home that Tom had put up.	54
6	1	2	1	It was a definite bachelor’s home and she was going to tidy it up the same way her mother did.  	96
6	1	2	2	It was cozy and solid.  	24
6	1	2	3	Captain Bradbury was not the neatest of men and Mary expected that.  	69
6	1	2	4	Captain Bradbury was also very studious, reading in the evenings by candle, often going to the candle makers to get more and so Mary started her hobby of reading back up.  	172
6	1	2	5	There weren’t so many mouths to feed and children to watch so Mary felt a lot of ease for the time being. 	106
6	1	2	6	There were chores taking care of the horses, the cows, sheep and chickens and his small garden and fields.  	108
6	1	2	7	He took care of most of that work.  	36
6	1	2	8	Mary was happy to get plenty of butter from the cow and had constant cooking and cleaning during the day. 	106
6	1	2	9	But by the time night came, they settled in, drank some ale, ate dinner, read books and settled in.	99
6	1	3	1	Tom went to town with her and they looked at books, hats, dresses, boots and farming tools together. 	101
6	1	3	2	He took her to eat some beef pies.  	36
6	1	3	3	Two hot pies came out of the oven at the tavern.  	50
6	1	3	4	Mary took one whiff and started to feel nauseated.  	52
6	1	3	5	She felt a tingle in her belly.	31
6	1	4	1	“Did you cook this pie Sir?”	28
6	1	4	2	, Tom yelled at the servant boy who served it.	46
6	1	5	1	“Tom, the pie is ok, it’s just me.”	35
6	1	6	1	“Sorry.” he yelled at the boys who shrugged and went back to the hearth fires. 	79
6	1	6	2	He quickly turned back to Mary.	31
6	1	7	1	“What’s has fallen over you?”	29
6	1	8	1	“Tom, I think we’re going to have a baby!”	42
6	1	9	1	Tom’s eyes gleamed and mouth opened in surprise, his mind raced and hands went through his hair in amazement at the prospect of his having a son.  	147
6	1	9	2	He felt very pleased that he would soon be starting his family and continuing his family’s legacy.	98
6	1	10	1	Out of the ongoing excitement, out of the blue, a familiar name was overheard. 	79
6	1	10	2	Two men were conversing.	24
6	1	11	1	“Reverend Williams is in regular trouble.  	43
6	1	11	2	Did you hear they went to look for him and he had escaped?”	59
6	1	12	1	“In January? 	13
6	1	12	2	Wasn’t that the same day as that wretched blizzard that came through? 	70
6	1	12	3	How did he do it?”	18
6	1	13	1	“Apparently, those savages who he’s friends with picked him up and took him to their camp in hiding.”	101
6	1	14	1	“I can’t believe how bad this war is getting.  	47
6	1	14	2	They’re going to be calling up the rest of us if this doesn’t end soon.”	72
6	1	15	1	“With all these arguments, it’s no wonder that God’s displeasure has been shown by riling up these savages against us.”	119
6	1	16	1	“It’s more than that Good Sir, it’s the abuses they’ve received at the hands of our …” (he fell to a whisper).	110
6	1	17	1	“Well, they’re starting to give out the names.  	48
6	1	17	2	I currently now live in Andover.”	33
6	1	18	1	“I think they don’t want to give the Indians the idea that it’s still their land.”	82
6	1	19	1	“That’s why Williams got the boot, he was against taking it outright and giving it our name because they were taking offense to that.”	134
6	1	20	1	“They’re not producing anything, we’re the ones being taxed, we have to pay, we should be able to claim it by name like we would back in England.”	146
6	1	21	1	“So be it then.  	17
6	1	21	2	I pray this war ends soon so we’ll know what to tell….” 	56
6	1	21	3	(and he broke back into a whisper again).	41
6	1	22	1	Their eavesdropping was interrupted and they realized their food had gotten cold. 	82
6	1	22	2	After finishing their meal, Tom took Mary home. 	48
6	1	22	3	He was soon cleaning house.	27
6	1	23	1	As the fall came, Mary’s morning sickness was in full swing.  	62
6	1	23	2	Judith came over with John Jr. to help her as John Jr. was well respected by the tribe peoples along the way.  	111
6	1	23	3	His ability to speak with them improved.  	42
6	1	23	4	John Sr was starting to feel his age and had to keep watch over the children who were busy playing with wood scraps from the sawing table John Sr was using to build more shelter from.	183
6	1	24	1	“Mother!” 	10
6	1	24	2	exclaimed Mary as Judith came over her threshold throwing her skirts through.	77
6	1	25	1	“Mary, my beautiful daughter, I’m so pleased.  	47
6	1	25	2	I got the news.  	17
6	1	25	3	So, when do you think the baby will arrive?”	44
6	1	26	1	“I guess around March?”	23
6	1	27	1	“The house cleaning has improved. 	34
6	1	27	2	I hope you didn’t have to clean.”	33
6	1	28	1	“No–”	5
6	1	29	1	“How is the good captain? 	26
6	1	29	2	I mean, my new son in marriage?”	32
6	1	30	1	“He’s doing well.  	19
6	1	30	2	He just started teaching letters at the school.”	48
6	1	31	1	“Mary, now that harvest is over, we should find a camp betwixt our homes to teach at until the snows come and your progression with child grows late.  	151
6	1	31	2	The Indian girls have a great aptitude for our trade since they live close to our Mother.  	91
6	1	31	3	Let’s bring some of the village girls with us and see who has been granted the gifts of administering physick.”	111
6	1	32	1	“I don’t have any notion yet of whereabouts we would meet Mother.”	66
6	1	33	1	“I don’t mean half way dear, I mean close to you but outside your home. 	72
6	1	33	2	We need a secluded place and the Indian camp is a perfect place.  	66
6	1	33	3	Roger Williams assures me they will be very peaceful to us and we will be with the squaws and medicine men there who protect them.  	132
6	1	33	4	Their social order is not as primitive as so many of us think.”	63
6	1	34	1	“That would be fine if you know the camp.”	42
6	1	35	1	“Let’s go for a walk then.  	28
6	1	35	2	The sky is overcast but the rain is not yet.”	45
6	1	36	1	When they arrived at the camp, Mary looked around and saw beautifully painted skins and all kinds of bone jewelry.  	116
6	1	36	2	A woman came up.	16
6	1	37	1	“Mary, this is the chief’s wife. 	33
6	1	37	2	Squaw Mercy Wren”	17
6	1	38	1	“Mercy, this is Mary.”	22
6	1	39	1	“Good day to you Mary.” she spoke in near perfect English.	58
6	1	40	1	Taken aback Mary responded in kind, “Good day to you Mercy.”	60
6	1	41	1	Mary gave a curtsey and raised a hand in their home greeting. 	62
6	1	41	2	Mercy took them into a straw tube-like home.  	46
6	1	41	3	Inside the scent of roasted meats, herbs and the hanging of jewelry full of their memories outlined the well appointed hut.  	125
6	1	41	4	They took invitation to stay a night.	37
6	1	42	1	Thomas announced Mary’s dame school in church that week as an advanced exchange course in the sharing of language and culture between the old peoples and the colonists.  	170
6	1	42	2	The week after, Mary and Judith were teaching and initiating the women in the exchange of herb lore.	100
6	1	43	1	Mary wrote to Margaret.	23
6	1	45	1	Dear Margaret,	14
6	1	47	1	I’m sending this with my brother in hopes it will reach you quickly.  	70
6	1	47	2	We are here again hosting the Dame School.  	44
6	1	47	3	I am expecting a baby this year.  	34
6	1	47	4	Tom is most wonderful to me.  	30
6	1	47	5	Have you seen your husband Thomas?  	36
6	1	47	6	I hope he’s doing ok.  	23
6	1	47	7	Please come visit us.  	23
6	1	47	8	God bless you and preserve you.	31
6	1	49	1	Truly yours,	12
6	1	51	1	Mary Bradbury	13
6	2	1	1	As the weeks went on, some of the older women from church were brought along.  	79
6	2	1	2	There was Jane Hawkins, a middle aged lady with grey hair and a loose bonnet.  	79
6	2	1	3	Judith was thinking to avoid too much discussion of anything that might seem too miraculous so she went into the skill most demanded at the time, that being the art of a midwife and the practice of physic.	205
6	2	2	1	Just before class, Margaret Jones showed up.	44
6	2	3	1	“Margaret!” 	12
6	2	3	2	exclaimed Mary.  	17
6	2	3	3	Margaret sat next to her and they started chatting.  	53
6	2	3	4	Judith cleared her throat and they straightened up to listen, somehow, ever since the fire incident, both of them were keen to pay close attention to Judith.	157
6	2	4	1	“I’ll now answer any questions you have been holding onto” prompted Judith as she was in the middle of a large camp of women.	125
6	2	5	1	“What do you recommend for morning sickness?” 	46
6	2	5	2	asked Goodwife Colby.	21
6	2	6	1	“One of the remedies I have used myself for morning sickness and nausea has been chamomile and meadowsweet.”, answered Judith.	126
6	2	7	1	“Do you recommend raspberry leaf or yarrow before delivery time as a tonic to help contraction?”	96
6	2	7	2	, asked Jane.	13
6	2	8	1	“Either one or both work fine	29
6	2	8	2	.	1
6	2	8	3	“	1
6	2	9	1	“What about Mandrake?”	22
6	2	10	1	“I would not.  	15
6	2	10	2	It can severely disrupt the baby’s growth.  	44
6	2	10	3	They used to use it in small doses for calming and obtaining some benefit for the pain but I would not dare use it.  	117
6	2	10	4	Too many tragedies have happened there.  	41
6	2	10	5	Anyone else?”	13
6	2	11	1	Silence fell on the group and Judith went dismissed them.	57
6	3	1	1	A man in a black mask sat in a damp cave.  	43
6	3	1	2	A slave sat on one side of him. 	32
6	3	1	3	About three older ladies in their fifties sat in front of him.  	64
6	3	1	4	“I have heard your complaints and I have decided to act.  	58
6	3	1	5	Anne has been troublesome.  	28
6	3	1	6	She threatens to expose your arts as well as disrupt our effort to create a truly separate church from the Great Whore which is England.  	138
6	3	1	7	If she speaks against work, how will we accomplish our Great Work? 	67
6	3	1	8	The reason I have brought you here is to work with you.  	57
6	3	1	9	As Saul went to Endor, so do I come to you.  	45
6	3	1	10	We are the oldest group of midwives in the new world.  	55
6	3	1	11	You have served us in both the old land and this new land.  	60
6	3	1	12	Therefore, we must organize again like we did before. 	54
6	3	1	13	Mistress of the Night, bring me my blade.”, spoke the man.	58
6	3	2	1	The slave girl brought out a sharp knife and a bowl full of offerings from a tablet where it laid before a dark rounded column.  	129
6	3	2	2	Flowers, mandrakes, tobacco and bones sat in it.	48
6	3	3	1	“Stretch forth your left hands.”	32
6	3	4	1	The three women stretched out their pale wrinkled arms, their hands covered in liver spots and blemishes and scars.	115
6	3	5	1	“Do you swear to me by your blood.”, he asked muffled under the mask.	69
6	3	6	1	“I do.” spake the hooded ladies in unison.	42
6	3	7	1	He stretched his hand forth to cut their arms one by one.  	59
6	3	7	2	As each one bled, the slave girl collected the blood in the bowl.	65
6	3	8	1	He took the bowl, went off a ways for a few minutes and came back with the bowl which was now fuller.  	103
6	3	8	2	He passed it around and then said, “Drink!”	43
6	3	9	1	They drank in turn, their unbound grey hairs fell out of their hoods as they did so, slurping and cooing with delight as they did.	130
6	3	10	1	“Jane Hawkins, where are you?”	30
6	3	11	1	“Here Master.”	14
6	3	12	1	“As you were first to drink of me and your sisters, and have reported to me the workings of the other newcomers who practice the physic here, I wish to bless and honor you for your diligence.  	193
6	3	12	2	You have set the example and therefore you will lead in my absence and I give you the ancient name of Hecate, Queen of the Night.”	130
6	3	13	1	“Hecate, Bethuliah reports that Mary Dyer is with child.  	58
6	3	13	2	Play the part of a familist and zealot to gain Anne Hutchinson’s trust.  	73
6	3	13	3	Go to her to offer your services as midwife.  	46
6	3	13	4	Give to her the prescription you have perfected as a physic that will cause her child to transform into the image of Prince Stolas who will steal her child as it is born, that the Reverends will see her dissent for what it is.  	228
6	3	13	5	This work will please our Lord who seeks to keep us at our stations in this new kingdom.”	89
6	3	14	1	“Our wills are one, so will I go and do as you have said.” replied Jane now relishing in her new identity.	106
6	3	15	1	“Dorothy Talbye?”	17
6	3	16	1	“I will speak to you of your errand at our next meeting and if you do it well, I will give you and your companion both names and a standing in this our secret council of physic.”	178
6	3	17	1	“Now let us feast and celebrate amongst ourselves.”	51
6	3	18	1	The three women danced around the black phallic rounded obelisk-like stone, caressing themselves and preparing themselves to be pleasurable to their master.	156
6	3	19	1	Jane Hawkins went murmuring to herself  Anne, the nerve of her going to my neighbors to take away my employ and livelihood. 	124
6	3	19	2	She walked to her cauldron where she was preparing the oil of mandrakes, skimming the oils with a fibrous wad soaked with a waxy grease that would pick up the oil and leave the water.  	185
6	3	19	3	She painstakingly took the wad to exude and press the oils out into a handmade vial made from a lacquered stalk.  	114
6	3	19	4	From that day, she followed Anne and Mary around, befriending the young ladies and asking Anne if she could be of assistance as a midwife to her friend, Mary Dyer.  	165
6	3	19	5	Anne cordially accepted with the encouragement she had felt she was receiving.	78
6	3	20	1	The next day, she walked all the way to Mary Dyer’s home.	57
6	3	21	1	“Good morning it is Goodwife Dyer!”	35
6	3	22	1	“Why good morning Goodwife Hawkins. 	36
6	3	22	2	Welcome to my home. 	20
6	3	22	3	Come in. 	9
6	3	22	4	Come in.” answered a beautiful youthful looking girl with light heather hair, rosy red cheeks complete with bubbly countenance to match her demeanor.  	151
6	3	22	5	She had the warm blush of her pregnancy in her.  	49
6	3	22	6	A big beautiful white hat was tied about her face framing it along with the sunshine coming in.	95
6	3	23	1	“Please, call me Jane my dear little girl. 	43
6	3	23	2	And my, you are certainly getting big now.  	44
6	3	23	3	I take it a strong girl like you has no troubles carrying.”	59
6	3	24	1	“If only that were true dear Jane.  	36
6	3	24	2	My back aches so very much now.”	32
6	3	25	1	“Oh, I’m so very sorry to hear that.  	38
6	3	25	2	As a mother and grandmother, I must confess that this is more common than I would wish.  	89
6	3	25	3	But, I have been graced with a listening ear and keen memory and remember the ladies of my day having a long kept secret of a wonderful herbal remedy that could bring much relief.”	180
6	3	26	1	“Oh, do you practice physic then?”	34
6	3	26	2	, asked Mary inquisitively.	27
6	3	27	1	“Of course dear, I’ve practiced physic for many years and all thanks to the Lord’s providence in giving us herbs for our maladies if only we would look and trust upon them with the guidance of his sweet Spirit.”	211
6	3	28	1	“Could you procure it for me?”	30
6	3	29	1	“I have been so busy with my duty in my practice but I just helped another lady in my care just a week ago.  	109
6	3	29	2	She couldn’t bear the strong taste of it.  	43
6	3	29	3	Poor dear.  	12
6	3	29	4	I should have some in my pouch here.  	38
6	3	29	5	Goodwife Dyer, we must believe together that this can work.  	61
6	3	29	6	Do you believe?”	16
6	3	30	1	“Believe …”, Mary Dyer started questioningly. 	46
6	3	30	2	Jane picked up on it and completed the thought.	47
6	3	31	1	“Believe in the power of my Art that I share with you this day?” 	65
6	3	31	2	she asked sternly.	18
6	3	32	1	“Yes, I believe.” replied Mary Dyer feeling a little uncomfortable.	67
6	3	33	1	“We should sit down and make it with tea then.”, Jane said halfway between a smile and black and yellow toothed grin and gestured her to the table.	147
6	3	34	1	Jane Hawkins and Mary Dyer sat down.  	38
6	3	34	2	Mary lit the fire, filled a small pot with water and put it over the fire to boil and then carefully poured the tea into hand painted cups she had reserved for her favorite guests.	180
6	3	35	1	“It goes down much easier with rosemary and mint, do you have some?” 	69
6	3	35	2	spoke Jane as she noticed some rosemary and mint hanging.	57
6	3	36	1	“I hear rosemary is very good.  	32
6	3	36	2	Here it is.”, said Mary Dyer as she handed over the drying rosemary and mint sprigs which had been hanging up for a long time so that it was already dusty.	155
6	3	37	1	Jane took the oil out of her pouch and poured some drops of it in her water.  	78
6	3	37	2	She took the dry dusty brittle leaves in her hand and pulverised them into a dust and spilled a half portion into each cup.	123
6	3	38	1	Mary Dyer gave it a sniff and then a sip and exclaimed: “It doesn’t taste bad to me.”	85
6	3	39	1	Jane sipped her tea, “I only gave you a little. 	48
6	3	39	2	Here, keep the whole vial.  	28
6	3	39	3	What I gave you now will only alleviate some of the pain.  	59
6	3	39	4	Take more as you need it.”	26
6	3	40	1	“Oh thank you my dear Jane!” 	29
6	3	40	2	and she gave the middle aged lady a big smile and then opened her arms so as to embrace her in a hug.  	103
6	3	40	3	“You’re just like a mother to me.”	34
6	3	41	1	Jane smiled wryly back out of her view but returned the embrace full force with all subtleness.	95
6	3	42	1	One a brisk windy October morning, word came by a boy of about twelve years running to Mary Bradbury’s home saying in his breathlessness that Anne Hutchinson had requested her presence as a midwife to help in the delivery of Mary Dyer’s baby which had given them some surprise by showing signs several months early.  	317
6	3	42	2	Mary Bradbury had been invited by Anne Hutchinson to attend, having heard of her skills through Reverend Roger Williams.	120
6	3	43	1	Thomas took Mary by coach and then returned late to teach his classes.  	72
6	3	43	2	There in their home, Mary was taken by Anne Hutchinson’s hand, passing a crowd of strangers except few, to where Mary Dyer was.  	129
6	3	43	3	There she saw Jane Hawkins who smiled up at her.  	50
6	3	43	4	Mary was breathing heavily and exposed over rags which had been soaked with the water breaking.  	97
6	3	43	5	Anne and Jane both took an arm of Mary Dyer. 	45
6	3	43	6	Another woman pushed in behind Mary to get a glimpse of them. 	62
6	3	43	7	Mary Dyer labored all day and into the night.  	47
6	3	43	8	Regular squirming and shaking and moaning lasted a good part of the day.  	74
6	3	43	9	She went in and out of tiredness of labor aching through each step, barely making progress in her opening.	106
6	3	44	1	Finally, late in the evening, a bloody appendage that looked like a claw poked out.  	85
6	3	44	2	Mary’s head began to get light.  	33
6	3	44	3	Another girl stepped forward and spoke to Jane, “Can I get  you more clothes?”	78
6	3	45	1	“No need sister, we need more space, everyone except you, you and you please step away!” 	89
6	3	45	2	shouted Jane.  	15
6	3	45	3	She pointed to Anne and the girl who had offered the cloths.  	62
6	3	45	4	That was John Endicott’s servant girl she had seen before.  	60
6	3	45	5	Mary Bradbury could see there was more than enough help being offered to Goodwife Dyer but was concerned at how pale and sullen she looked compared to her usual upbeat nature.  	177
6	3	45	6	Mary closed the door behind the five of them.	45
6	3	46	1	Jane gave Mary Dyer another sip of tea on a rag she had soaked.  	65
6	3	46	2	“There there, this shall help.”  	33
6	3	46	3	She looked down again and saw that the baby was breech presented. 	66
6	3	46	4	“Aye, it was as I knew, this babe is coming hiplings first.”, Jane carefully rotated the body.  	96
6	3	46	5	“It’s in distress.”	19
6	3	47	1	At least she’s been taught how to use the herbs. thought Mary but something down deep pricked her like a splinter.  	116
6	3	47	2	She was worried the baby may have lost the limb during the pushing.  	69
6	3	47	3	Jane was rough but an older woman who had probably seen many births.  	70
6	3	47	4	The screaming and dribbles of blood poured onto the floor.  	60
6	3	47	5	The room then started to shake. 	32
6	3	47	6	Mary Dyer was thrashing on the bed with the pain. 	50
6	3	47	7	Anne comforted her and held onto her. 	38
6	3	47	8	A stench came out of the room that was thick.   	48
6	3	47	9	It seemed a sick green gray light filled the room as the dusk seemed to loom on beyond its hour.  	98
6	3	47	10	All of a sudden, the sound of vomiting and heaving filled the main hall.  	74
6	3	47	11	Mary covered her nose with several handkerchiefs scented with the wildflowers and peeked out to see people’s faces buried in cloth from the stench, there was vomit on the floor, purging as people walked out of the room and children were even clutching their midsections and flailing around.  	292
6	3	47	12	Other babies were wailing and crying.  	39
6	3	47	13	She closed the door to look inside again.	41
6	3	48	1	The rest of infant had come out.  	34
6	3	48	2	It was limp, barely blush, mostly pale and starting to blotch with liver mortis.  	82
6	3	48	3	Mary Bradbury thought she saw an occasional twitch from the mass of flesh that laid there.  	92
6	3	48	4	The baby had no head but had a face with bulging eyes, a strange hooked nose and an exposed circle of gumline and stray teeth for a mouth with stretched lips setting in between two shoulders where a neck would be. 	214
6	3	48	5	The ears stood up on the sides of the shoulders. 	49
6	3	48	6	There were bony protrusions of shoulder behind the eyes where the brow would be. 	81
6	3	48	7	The spine protruded out of the back as if it were a third arm. 	63
6	3	48	8	Two cavities leading to lungs protruded along the spine exposed through the skin.  	83
6	3	48	9	Under the spine was the baby’s belly and her organ and a tail stuck out.  	74
6	3	48	10	It was scaly skinned. 	22
6	3	48	11	The arms stretched straight down. 	34
6	3	48	12	Attached below the ribs were the legs, shorter but stiffened out so that the feet met the hands. 	97
6	3	48	13	Her hands and feet looked like skin covering bone to the point they resembled owl’s feet and her hands like wings.  	116
6	3	48	14	The cord seemed almost a tail.  	32
6	3	48	15	With further pushing, Mary expelled the last of it from her womb.  	67
6	3	48	16	Mary Bradbury, lightheaded now left the room while the other girl looked at it leaving her alone with Anne and Jane and the exhausted mother.  	143
6	3	48	17	Soon after she closed the door, she heard Goodwife Dyer’s voice shriek in anguish.  	84
6	3	48	18	Voices of comfort could be heard from Anne and Jane.	52
6	3	49	1	Mary woke up in the middle of the Dyer home.  	46
6	3	49	2	She was starting to feel the pain herself.  	44
6	3	49	3	In a fog, she saw an even larger crowd assembled among other women who had passed out. 	87
6	3	49	4	William Dyer was asking the people cleaning the floor to leave.  	65
6	3	49	5	Others heard this and left along with them.  	45
6	3	49	6	Mary stumbled out of the home to see Thomas there waiting for her.  	68
6	3	49	7	He was looking pale himself.	28
6	3	50	1	“Let’s leave this place,”, he said and then took Mary by the hand, holding her as she stumbled along towards the cart.	118
6	4	1	1	It was a sunny day in Salem. 	29
6	4	1	2	John Endicott and George Carr were watching the ship George had built for him cross the North River. 	101
6	4	1	3	He thought to himself, “I can do even better. 	46
6	4	1	4	The Caribbean would be a good place to start, send some of my boys over there and trade the excess and set up a plantation there.” 	131
6	4	1	5	He spoke aloud, “You’ve done a fine job there.” 	48
6	4	1	6	Just as he was glorying in the view of his ownings, a black smoke rose straight up from the vessel. 	100
6	4	1	7	George watched in horror too. 	30
6	4	1	8	He knew he might have used too much oil in the polish but in his wiles he responded quickly. 	93
6	4	1	9	Knowing full well that John often bought up supplies from the Perkins and the Bradburys to George’s disdain, his scapegoat couldn’t be clearer,“That witch! 	156
6	4	1	10	I knew I should have stopped you from buying bewitched oil from those crafty folks.” 	85
6	4	1	11	John bought it.	15
6	4	2	1	“You’re right, I should have listened. 	39
6	4	2	2	I’ll never buy from them again. 	32
6	4	2	3	I’m afraid I have no choice but to cut my loss and pay you percents from the portions I got from the previous trips.”	117
6	4	3	1	“But that cost me..”	20
6	4	4	1	“Cost both of us, we have to split the loss. 	45
6	4	4	2	For your loss, I’ll throw in my goat corral.”	45
6	4	5	1	George was still fuming but stopped himself from attacking Mr. 	63
6	4	5	2	Endicott. 	10
6	4	5	3	He knew he would lose that fight. 	34
6	4	5	4	It was customary to split losses on joint ventures like these. 	63
6	4	5	5	He had only supplied the shipping and labor and none of the other expenses or supplies. 	88
6	4	5	6	“Mary told me once she could spark fire with a breath.”	55
6	4	6	1	“I don’t have anything substantial to go on. 	45
6	4	6	2	You take care of her, I’ll get to the damage mitigation here.” 	63
6	4	6	3	With that, John stomped off cursing under his breathe and pulling his face away from George.	92
6	5	1	1	By January, Mary was feeling more and more nervous.  	53
6	5	1	2	Thomas was becoming too helpful making Mary feel a little frustrated.	69
6	5	2	1	“Can I get you some water?”	27
6	5	3	1	“How about some milk?”	22
6	5	4	1	Mary shook her head.	20
6	5	5	1	“Sorry, what would you like?”	29
6	5	6	1	“Just relax Tommy”, she teased giving half a smile. 	52
6	5	6	2	“Ok, just help me up so I can walk to the pot.  	48
6	5	6	3	I like the warmth there.  	26
6	5	6	4	From there I’ll make myself some lemon and mint tea.”	53
6	5	7	1	“So have you picked a name if it’s going to be a girl yet?”	59
6	5	8	1	“I told you it’s not a girl but if it is, I’ll name her Isabella or after my mother.”	85
6	5	9	1	“I like Judith, it’s a good bible name.” answered Tom.	54
6	5	10	1	“Are you sure you want Wymond?  	32
6	5	10	2	I already told you it sounds too close to Waylon,” said Mary.	61
6	5	11	1	“That’s my grandfather’s name and I want to remember him here.  	64
6	5	11	2	Who knows but if someday, someone won’t look for my father and will not know which of these Bradbury men they were?”	116
6	5	12	1	“I will name him Wymond.  	26
6	5	12	2	Your grandfather might be more apt to watch over him this way. 	63
6	5	12	3	It’s different enough, and I do like it.  	42
6	5	12	4	It’s a special name.  	22
6	5	12	5	I didn’t know of it until I met you.”	37
6	5	13	1	Tom smiled and put his arm around Mary and put his hand gently over her belly. 	79
6	5	13	2	“I love you Mary my dear wife and I already know you love me.” he smiled again.	79
6	5	14	1	Mary looked up at him which prompted him to kiss her.  	55
6	5	14	2	He gave her a gentle kiss and held her in his arms.	51
6	5	15	1	The lion rains of March persisted to the last day.  	52
6	5	15	2	Mary walked about, taking care of herself.  	44
6	5	15	3	She wondered why did didn’t ask for a midwife.  	48
6	5	15	4	Then the next day, she heard the knock and it was her father and mother standing there in the rain.	99
6	5	16	1	“Hellos. 	9
6	5	16	2	Elizabeth is watching the kids for us.”, said Judith bustling in.  	67
6	5	16	3	John sauntered in right after her, taking his hat off and setting it on the table.	82
6	5	17	1	They stayed over night and by the wee hours of that morning, a tired Judith awoke to hear Mary tossing and groaning with the sound of labor pains and contractions.  	165
6	5	17	2	They had arrived just in time if not a little late in Mary’s eyes.	66
6	5	18	1	“Mary, your baby!”	18
6	5	19	1	“I know mother!”	16
6	5	20	1	“Breathe my daughter.  	23
6	5	20	2	I’ll ready everything!”	23
6	5	21	1	Judith went to work preparing everything.  	43
6	5	21	2	“Where do you keep your salves and herbs?”	42
6	5	22	1	“In the box mother, you remember don’t you!”	44
6	5	23	1	“Where’s the box!?”	19
6	5	24	1	“It’s by my bed!”	17
6	5	25	1	“Silly me!”	11
6	5	26	1	Judith prepared clean cloths and made Thomas and John leave the room.  	71
6	5	26	2	It wouldn’t be good luck.  	27
6	5	26	3	Judith had learned a lot from the Indian women as she had watched them deliver.   	82
6	5	26	4	Judith had set down a few charms at her bedside after she arrived that these women gave her to give for Mary’s baby. 	117
6	5	26	5	Judith had Mary drink water and teas despite how full she felt.	63
6	5	27	1	The sun had not even risen yet, dawn’s faint light just barely coming out and Mary’s water had already broke.  	111
6	5	27	2	There were Indian women who came that morning.  	48
6	5	27	3	Thomas had gone out to gather them.  	37
6	5	27	4	They shook a rattle and held her hand and massaged her where she was most comfortable being massaged.  	103
6	5	27	5	The contractions came even quicker and more evenly and the baby was crowning.  	79
6	5	27	6	Judith coached Mary’s pushing but in rhythm.  	46
6	5	27	7	Mary’s pushing came more easily and soon Judith was holding a shoulder and he was twisting his way slightly out on his own.  	125
6	5	27	8	He was pink and sleepy looking.  	33
6	5	27	9	By the time Mary pushed him out, he was kicking frantically and started to yawn.  	82
6	5	27	10	Judith was surprised but all of a sudden, she touched him and he cried out loud enough for the whole farm to hear.  	116
6	5	27	11	Thomas could be heard hollering in joy along with John Senior.  	64
6	5	27	12	They ran in.	12
6	5	28	1	“You are the new proud father of a son.”, Judith drew out as Thomas tried to get a better view.  	97
6	5	28	2	Mary held her baby in her arms rocking him.	43
6	5	29	1	“Wymond.” she held her baby close.  	36
6	5	29	2	She repeated his name several times.  	38
6	5	29	3	Everyone looked into his eyes and he stared back in a fresh amazement Mary had seen a few times before but this was special.  	126
6	5	29	4	She studied his face amazed at the likeness he had of them both.  	66
6	5	29	5	John Senior put an arm around his wife and muttered a “good job” to her kissing her on the forehead.  	102
6	5	29	6	Thomas looked a little taken back by this show for a second.  	62
6	5	29	7	He went right back to holding onto his wife as she held their son.  	68
6	5	29	8	He followed suit and held Mary.  	33
6	5	29	9	Judith went off to find some more water to wash the up after the baby with.  	77
6	5	29	10	There was a great flood to clean up it seemed.	46
6	5	30	1	Mary took a long rest and Thomas got a new cradle out for her and sat there watching him letting Mary rest a bit.  	115
6	5	30	2	She needed to heal but before long, Wymond was already crying in hunger.  	74
6	5	30	3	Thomas handed him back and Mary was soon nursing her suckling boy for the first time.	85
6	5	31	1	“Hecate, your work was careless but work as I have planned. 	60
6	5	31	2	The leak you gave to the young lass has started to spread like wildfire against Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer and the others who have disrupted our plans.”	155
6	5	32	1	“It was delicious to watch it Master.  	39
6	5	32	2	They will soon be exhuming the body to view it in it’s horror again thanks to my connection.  	94
6	5	32	3	She was all too easy and eager to be lead about.”	49
6	5	33	1	“I have an even greater source of concern.  	44
6	5	33	2	I fear that while the Bradburys are playing the part of dutiful helpful citizen and are forthcoming of admission about their relationship with Gorges, they are in a position to undermine us.  	192
6	5	33	3	Mary knows what you did and are well connected.  	49
6	5	33	4	They could take any side.”	26
6	5	34	1	“So what shall we do?”	22
6	5	35	1	“I want to bring her to our side but we have to remove the influences around her. 	82
6	5	35	2	Who can we find that is close to Mary?  	40
6	5	35	3	Maybe they can be persuaded to help us.”	40
6	5	36	1	“Margaret Jones is one of Mary’s best friends, between Goodwife Perkins, and the two of them, they could easily thwart us or expose us since they are also organized. 	166
6	5	36	2	Our only advantage is that they do not know o f us	50
6	5	36	3	.	1
6	5	36	4	 “	2
6	5	37	1	“Can Margaret be swayed?”	25
6	5	38	1	“No, she is more loyal to Mary than her own husband even though both of them have dissented.”	93
6	5	39	1	“Hrm.  	7
6	5	39	2	This might work in our favor.  	31
6	5	39	3	Those who cannot be swayed are of strong opinion and easy to get a rise out of.  	81
6	5	39	4	We have to conduct an operation to discredit her and remove her.  	66
6	5	39	5	I need you to use your best poison on her neighbor’s cattle.  	62
6	5	39	6	I then want you to start a little mischief between them so that they will contend with her.  	93
6	5	39	7	If she practices the art of the physical bodies, we can spoil her remedies so that they make her patients ill.  	112
6	5	39	8	Go in and visit her.  	22
6	5	39	9	Taking Margaret out will serve as a good warning to Mary.”	58
6	5	40	1	“What if instead we use the third plot in the Book of Power against our competitors where Margaret is found with a remedy that appears to poison her and that remedy is planted on Mary and we tip them to investigate Mary?”	221
6	5	41	1	“That would not work.  	23
6	5	41	2	Mary is far too perceptive.  	29
6	5	41	3	You might as well just poison her outright with the prescription that gives the appearance of the pox.  	104
6	5	41	4	She has cut you off from her completely because of your carelessness in this last execution.  	94
6	5	41	5	Her familiars keep watch and inform her should you come near.  	63
6	5	41	6	Do not be troubled, I will clean up after your carelessness and soon we’ll have Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer taken out while keeping Mary Bradbury distracted.  	161
6	5	41	7	There is much to be gained from this plot if you do it well this time. 	71
6	5	41	8	Use my first plan and come back when you’ve finished it.”	57
6	5	42	1	“Where is Dorothy?”	19
6	5	43	1	“I have given her a task.  	27
6	5	43	2	I’m afraid we will no longer be seeing her.  	45
6	5	43	3	The task I have given her will likely put her in the hands of the magistrates,” his grin widened. 	98
6	5	43	4	“I don’t think she’ll be coming back.”	38
6	5	44	1	The next week, Dorothy Talbye was arrested on charges of murdering her own child.  	83
6	5	44	2	Jane Hawkins came back to the masked man.	41
6	5	45	1	“So that is the task you gave her?”	35
6	5	46	1	“Do not trouble over her.  	27
6	5	46	2	She was a risk I could no longer afford.  	42
6	5	46	3	Have you done the task I’ve given you?”	39
6	5	47	1	“I have, the cattle are sick and her neighbors are quarrelling with her now.”	77
6	5	48	1	“I have the exact manual we can use to shut down our distractors and our competitors.  	87
6	5	48	2	We cannot let them increase in our land or they will destroy our way of life.  	79
6	5	48	3	I have here a book on how to detect witches from Matthew Hopkins.  	67
6	5	48	4	His techniques for discovering the witch will be easy to implicate anyone we wish to.”, the man changed his voice into a kind sweet sounding old man: “My beloved saints, we owe it to God and His Country to mete out His Fair Punishments to those who would fight against the establishment of His Kingdom on earth.  	313
6	5	48	5	To be the hand of God, we must not hold back to mete them to these charlatans who so richly merit His Punishment”.	114
6	5	49	1	Jane Hawkins laughed loudly at his perfect inflections and poise of a righteous God fearing Reverend.	101
6	5	50	1	Boston - June 1648	18
6	5	51	1	The next day, Margaret Jones was arrested and placed in jail.  	63
6	5	51	2	As she was chained up, John Endecott entered the room and pulled out a flexible stick covered in burrs and sharp items stuck into it. 	134
6	5	51	3	John Endecott tortured her while she was prisoner to extract information. 	74
6	5	51	4	After many confessions and much bleeding, sweat and tears and repeat questions he asked her:	92
6	5	52	1	“Can Mary start a fire without flint and only her words?”	57
6	5	53	1	“Yes. 	6
6	5	53	2	I saw it with my own eyes.”	27
6	5	54	1	John brought the indictments to the General Court that afternoon but kept that secret to himself.	97
6	5	55	1	William Pychon was the presiding judge of the General Court:	60
6	5	56	1	“Will the accused step forth and give her name?”	48
6	5	57	1	“Margaret Jones”	16
6	5	58	1	“I will now read the charges against Margaret Jones standing here in this court this day all of which may constitute counts towards the greater and most deviant crime of witchcraft, a crime so great that it can destroy entire kingdoms. 	236
6	5	58	2	The accused is found to have the malignant touch that has caused many persons, men, women and children alike, whom she stroked or touched with any affection of displeasure, to be taken with deafness, vomiting, violent pains, or sickness. 	238
6	5	58	3	How do you plea Margaret Jones?”	32
6	5	59	1	Loud ruckus filled the room. 	29
6	5	59	2	Voices of “Guilty!”	19
6	5	59	3	, “Do right and confess it!”	28
6	5	59	4	, “Witch!”	10
6	5	59	5	, “Tramp of the Devil!” 	24
6	5	59	6	with such screeching as to mimic the minions of hell themselves. 	65
6	5	59	7	Some also yelled innocent, among which was Mary.	48
6	5	60	1	“Silence! 	10
6	5	60	2	I mean Order! 	14
6	5	60	3	Order or you will soon find your SELF on the stand!” 	53
6	5	60	4	bellowed the judge. 	20
6	5	60	5	The commotion continued but faded down.	39
6	5	61	1	“How does the accused plea!?”	29
6	5	62	1	“Innocent!  	12
6	5	62	2	I am wholly innocent of touching anyone ….except as they beckon me ... to apply healing salve. 	95
6	5	62	3	They are impatient and their complaints too difficult for my treatment I confess but I do not intend any malignancy or wish any further pain or harm!”	150
6	5	63	1	More noise filled the room as she went on.  	44
6	5	63	2	Judge Pychon stood up and this time hollered at the court and motioned for his deputies.	88
6	5	64	1	“ORDER!” 	9
6	5	64	2	This time the room went to a deafening silence. 	48
6	5	64	3	At that point,	14
6	5	65	1	Increase Nowell held in his hands the book of Matthew Hopkins, The Discovery of Witches. 	89
6	5	65	2	John Endecott occasionally whispered in his ear.  	50
6	5	65	3	Increase would then show Judge Pychon the passages containing the list of accusations.  	88
6	5	65	4	The court’s test was the same as the books and if the evidence found her guilty of all these, then she would be guilty.  	121
6	5	65	5	The men and women she treated came forth and showed forth sores that remained on their skin.  	94
6	5	65	6	As Mary watched, something didn’t feel right about it but she was bound herself to not speak.  	95
6	5	65	7	She knew Margaret could not be spared without exposing her entire group.  	74
6	5	65	8	Her heart ached deeply.  	25
6	5	65	9	Margaret gave Mary the things she needed to know that gave her such success in the arts of a physic.	100
6	5	66	1	“You are accused of practicing physic with poisonous medicines. 	64
6	5	66	2	How do you plea?”	17
6	5	67	1	“I am innocent your Honor. 	27
6	5	67	2	With God as my witness, these are harmless. 	44
6	5	67	3	Nothing more than licorice and anise!”	38
6	5	68	1	“So you admit it that you make medicines that are ineffectual.”	63
6	5	69	1	“No, …”	7
6	5	70	1	“But you said they were just licorice and anise and you pretense these as medicines and do nothing.”	100
6	5	71	1	“Yes”	5
6	5	72	1	“So you defraud people?”	24
6	5	73	1	“No!”	5
6	5	74	1	“Either you are defrauding people with ineffective medicine or you are making medicines that have effects.”	107
6	5	75	1	“Yes, they have effects.””	26
6	5	76	1	“So now you have tried to defraud this court and have reversed your statement!”	79
6	5	77	1	“That is true Margaret. 	24
6	5	77	2	As a business owner myself, I have seen fraud. 	47
6	5	77	3	Will the plaintiff for this indictment come to present testimony?”	66
6	5	78	1	A man stepped forward, he was questioned a couple times with almost the same questions answering the same every time.  	119
6	5	78	2	“Did Margaret Jones give you medicine?”	39
6	5	79	1	“Yes”	5
6	5	80	1	“Did it make you sick?”	23
6	5	81	1	“Yes”	5
6	5	82	1	“Did she say what was in the medicine?”	39
6	5	83	1	“Licorice and”	14
6	5	84	1	“For a second time, who is Margaret Jones and did she give you medicine?”	73
6	5	85	1	“Yes”	5
6	5	86	1	“Did you give this Good man medicine?”	38
6	5	87	1	“Yes”	5
6	5	88	1	“That is enough evidence for that charge. 	42
6	5	88	2	Moving on.”	11
6	5	89	1	“But…”	6
6	5	90	1	“Margaret Jones, I’m the magistrate here, If you do not obey, you will be found guilty on all charges by default to the court for your misconduct.  	148
6	5	90	2	There is already evidence enough to convict you of witchcraft.  	64
6	5	90	3	It is in your interest to get through the rest of the charges if you would tip the scales in your favor Madam Jones.”	117
6	5	91	1	His suddenly kind tone made him sound sincerely impartial but she could tell he was manipulating the perception of the court.	125
6	5	92	1	“You are accused of malediction and curses towards those who do not use your physic that they will not heal and this has also been found self-evident by this man’s neighbor.”	174
6	5	93	1	Margaret recalled telling the plaintiff’s neighbor that her medicine would help him which he flatly refused. 	109
6	5	93	2	She never told him he would never recover but only that if he wanted to recover, he should earnestly try her physic. 	117
6	5	93	3	She recalled having been successful with others. 	49
6	5	93	4	The court brought in the neighbor and he complained that no treatment would ever work ever since he heard her curse him.  	122
6	5	93	5	She wasn’t sure why she was the object of these perjurers and false witnesses.  	80
6	5	93	6	Their anger towards her seemed unjustified.  	45
6	5	93	7	Mary however felt that this was payback to her since she herself was untouchable, the best they could do is destroy her friends and family. 	140
6	5	93	8	Margaret noticed now that he didn’t even ask for her plea. 	59
6	5	93	9	The evidence for the checklist they used was biased.  	54
6	5	93	10	There was no examination or recourse to defend against it.  	60
6	5	93	11	She was being tried by a merchant not a lawyer like those in England.  	71
6	5	93	12	Winthrop was a politician.  	28
6	5	93	13	Not a judge of legal talent but Margaret saw something sinister in all the whisperings on the bench by now and she was about to show them some real trouble.	156
6	5	94	1	Mary was concerned for Margaret.  	34
6	5	94	2	Mary knew they were getting to her and that Margaret would not be able to pull off anything without making it worse for herself.  	130
6	5	94	3	The questioning got worse.  	28
6	5	94	4	That she then was able to foretell things and have secret knowledge that could only be obtained by the support of devils. 	122
6	5	94	5	Then they tore her clothes off and inspected her using pins, picked at her skin and after they picked it, they used it as evidence saying it was a teat.  	154
6	5	94	6	They said she had been caught feeding her familiar for which they asked her their names.  	90
6	5	94	7	They brought in several cats and mousers and had each of them slain to watch her reaction. 	91
6	5	94	8	The stripped her again and probed her in most vile ways, excusing themselves as being on a physic’s errand.	107
6	5	95	1	As Margaret had been in prison, they had brought her cellmates out against her who ratted on her for having children come to visit her.  	137
6	5	95	2	Curious children she tried to talk to would take interest but her cellmate used this in a testimony they no doubt coerced from her.  	133
6	5	95	3	Since Margaret was often watching children, she knew a lot of them and many of them wanted to know where she had disappeared to.  	130
6	5	95	4	They made veiled threats at the children and this broke Margaret’s temper.	74
6	5	96	1	“YOU ARE ALL DEMONS BEARING FALSE WITNESS! 	43
6	5	96	2	IT IS YOU WHO ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THE DEVIL! 	44
6	5	96	3	IT IS YOU WHO ARE GOING TO BURN IN FIRE AND BRIMSTONE!”	55
6	5	97	1	Mary’s heart sunk.  	20
6	5	97	2	She stared at the floor.	24
6	5	98	1	“You are hereby sentenced to death!”	36
6	5	99	1	Mary was sure something was skipped.  	38
6	5	99	2	They didn’t bother to read guilt or use jury or witness but were taking her out to be executed in short time.  	111
6	5	99	3	Margaret was yelling and screaming, crying along the way.  	59
6	5	99	4	She started to cast a spell that expressed Heaven’s own disdain.	64
6	5	100	1	She was taken out by cart on Lecture Day to a hill they now called Gallows Hill and there, she stared at them, bitterly, tears and indignation in her eyes.  	157
6	5	100	2	If they started to speak or pronounce on her she would rail.  	62
6	5	100	3	The executioner put the rope around her neck.  	47
6	5	100	4	She looked for her husband but he was gone.  	45
6	5	100	5	The children looked up at her with blank marble eyes.  	55
6	5	100	6	She was brought up to the platform and stared silently and the whole group stood in silence as clouds swirled above and the rope was placed on her neck.  	154
6	5	100	7	Her hands were bound.  	23
6	5	100	8	She struggled hopelessly.  	27
6	5	100	9	The executioner tightened the noose and then pushed her off like one would with a child on a swing but with a level of force that brought her back to the platform so that the executioner had to push her bound body away again.  	227
6	5	100	10	It was then that her neck made a pop and then broke into a shape elongated like that of a swan and her eyes burst open and bloodshot, teeth clenched in a fixed expression of horror with the rope hugging her jaw and her face turning a sick purple.  	248
6	5	100	11	The whole field of sky started clouding over as Margaret’s own eyes, heavenward gazing, clouded over and dried out.  	117
6	5	100	12	Children screamed in the background.  	38
6	5	100	13	The magistrates however gave each other a nod and a “job well done” look.  	75
6	5	100	14	John Winthrop, bookish as ever simply followed behind, his mouth turned down but walking as if duty bound and determined to do the world’s justice.  	149
6	5	100	15	His expression seemed to be that of sympathy until Margaret broke.  	68
6	5	100	16	His face was still of disgust, with the convictions of his own making to come to peaceful terms with himself.	109
6	5	101	1	Mary watched the clouds above.	30
6	5	102	1	“Storm approaches!” 	20
6	5	102	2	cried one of the ladies as the crowd continued to stare and mumble as the drizzles and winds picked up their paces.	115
6	5	103	1	A frigid cold wind burst in on the June summer scene as unusual as a sudden intrusion of winter.   	99
6	5	103	2	Winds blew at them to the point hats took flight and trees creaked.  	69
6	5	103	3	Everyone including Mary took to their own feet, carts and saddles for a ride home.  	84
6	5	103	4	Thomas was dumbstruck and tears started to drip off each cheek as he witnessed the worst injustice in his life that day.  	122
6	5	103	5	Even though he was not a stranger to tragedies and Mary neither, his heart was shearing and shredding itself over the sight of that day.  	138
6	5	103	6	Nightmares plagued him for weeks, wondering to himself what he could have done to spare Mary’s dearest and oldest friend in the colony.	135
7	1	1	1	It was just after the vernal equinox at the Perkin’s home on Manning Neck, when the illnesses of cold like influenza and hypothermia would give way to the illnesses of the heat like allergies and heat exhaustion.	212
7	1	2	1	John and Judith were feeling the effects of their age and planned expediently for their deaths which Judith had predicted would arrive in the year.  	149
7	1	2	2	Judith took her husband to the Ipswich county court house to record his last will.	82
7	1	3	1	Last Will and Testament of John Perkins Sr.	43
7	1	4	1	On this 28th of the first month called March, 1654. 	52
7	1	4	2	I, John Perkins the Elder of Ipswich being at this time sick and weak in body yet through the mercy and goodness of the Lord retaining my understanding and memory: do thus dispose of and bequeath my temporal estate as followeth: first I do give and bequeath unto my eldest son John Perkins (1), a foal of my young mare being new with foal; if it please the Lord she foaled it well also I give and bequeath to my son John’s two sons John and Abraham to each of them one of my yearling heifers: also I give and bequeath to my son Thomas Perkins (2) one cow and one heifer also I give and bequeath to his son John Perkins one ewe to be delivered for his use at the next shearing time; also I do give and bequeath to my daughter Elizabeth Sargeant (3) one cow and an heifer to be to her and her children after her decease as it may please ye Lord they may increase the profits or increase to be equally divided amongst the said children also I do give to my daughter Mary Bradbury (4) one cow and one heifer or a young steer to remain to her and to her children in their increase or profits as it shall please the Lord to bless them and to be equally divided to the children: also I do give and bequeath to my daughter Lydia Bennett (5) one cow and one heifer or steer to be equally divided to her children in their increase and profits after her decease: I doe also give unto my grandchild Thomas Bradbury one ewe to be set apart for his use at ye next shearing time: also I do give and bequeath unto my son Jacob Perkins (6) my dwelling house together with all the out-housing, and all my lands of one kind and other together with all improvements thereupon to be his in full possession and according to a former covenant, after the decease of my wife and not before and so to remain to him and to his heirs forever: all the rest of my estate of one kind and other I doe wholly leave to my deare wife Judith Perkins appointing and ordaining my said wife the sole executrix of this my Last Will and Testament desiring my said wife to dispose of the cattle above mentioned according to her discretion as they shall prosper: steers or heifers as also to dispose of some of the increase or some of the increase of the sheep to the children of my son Thomas and of my three daughters at the discretion of my said wife and this I do ordain as my Last Will and Testament subscribed with mine own hand this twenty-eighth day of the first month  1654:	2440
7	1	5	1	His Mark	8
7	1	6	1	John Y. 	8
7	1	6	2	Perkins	7
7	1	7	1	Witness: William Bartholomew, Thomas Harris.	44
7	1	8	1	Proved in Ipswich Court 26:7:1653 by the Witnesses	50
7	1	10	1	It was a cool September, the autumnal equinox when John Perkins passed, a sign Judith took for both a life well lived and a sign for her own departure.  	153
7	1	10	2	Judith sent word through her neighbors in Ipswich for the burial of her husband and sent word to her children.  	112
7	1	10	3	They arrived throughout the day household by household to find Judith sick in her bed.	86
7	1	11	1	The women and children approached her to listen to her. 	56
7	1	11	2	Mary’s son Thomas was prodded to go along with them being thirteen still.  	75
7	1	11	3	In addition to Wymond who was now seventeen years of age, their second child was Judith who looked more like a younger version of Mary and a year younger than Wymond.  	168
7	1	11	4	Then came the third child Thomas, who was named in the will and named after his father (and incidentally Mary’s brother) and thirteen years old as said before.  	161
7	1	11	5	Then the fourth child was Mary, named after mother accordingly and age twelve. 	79
7	1	11	6	Fifth was Jane named after Captain Bradbury’s sister and age nine, Sixth was Jacob, age seven. 	95
7	1	11	7	Seventh was William after Thomas uncle age five, Eighth was Elizabeth age three and named for both Captain Bradbury’s mother and Mary’s sister, and then John, named for Mary’s father and brother and only five months old and seemingly quiet for Mary compared to her other children.	280
7	1	12	1	“We’re so saddened about father, we knew he was weak with age but in our hope, we were taken by surprise.”	106
7	1	13	1	“The Lord has taken him to a new post and calling.  	52
7	1	13	2	He’ll be the guardian of the worthy among our posterity in spirit as will I soon.”	82
7	1	14	1	“Mother, you must not talk that way.”	37
7	1	15	1	“Now, cough– Listen here.  	27
7	1	15	2	Elizabeth, Mary, Lydia, come close. 	36
7	1	15	3	I trust you will carry on our tradition. 	41
7	1	15	4	I have something for each of you. 	34
7	1	15	5	Each of you princesses. 	24
7	1	15	6	“Elizabeth, you are the eldest and therefore, I will give you the secrets of the hag.”, Judith handed her a diary with several pages torn out of it and handed her a spindle whorl with a Hwicce emblem.	200
7	1	16	1	“Mary, I give you the mother’s secret, you have the most children of the three of my daughters, so I give you my receipt book and my notes on the herbs”, Judith handed her another book, a stirring stick and the little box. 	223
7	1	16	2	“You will also need this some day.”	35
7	1	17	1	“Lydia, I give you my almanac and the notes in there on gardening.”, Judith handed her the book and a broom.	108
7	1	18	1	“Let me see my grandchildren.” as Judith nodded in John Jr’s direction.	71
7	1	19	1	Each of her grandchildren took Judith’s hand and kissed it. 	60
7	1	19	2	She attempted to hug them but was starting to cough too much.  	63
7	1	19	3	Mary’s son Wymond who was seventeen now went up to her and she stopped him for a moment.	88
7	1	20	1	“Wymond, you’re a grown man already, you’ll soon have a son of your own and a grandson he will give you who will have a very upright and honorable man to take the place of those dishonest men who now sit on the judgement seat. 	227
7	1	20	2	He shall have a daughter who has the same gifts that your mother has.”	70
7	1	21	1	Mary kept these words to heart and wrote them in her own diary.	63
7	1	22	1	By the next morning, Judith had passed and everyone wept sorely for her.  	74
7	1	22	2	Elizabeth was heartbroken and wailed loudly and fainted.  	58
7	1	22	3	Her husband William calmed her down and took her by the hand. 	62
7	1	22	4	When Mary had seen the will, she saw that Thomas was the only child John Sr. had mentioned.  	93
7	1	22	5	He was only thirteen yet named very specifically.  	51
7	1	22	6	Mary knew how much Thomas liked to spin and weave wonderful fabrics together and that he would likely never marry or give her children. 	136
7	1	22	7	Thomas had an eye for the other boys of the village which she tried to keep hidden since there were many who would taunt him for it.  	134
7	1	22	8	She was also surprised that her father had also known.  	56
7	1	22	9	Maybe Judith was already keenly aware of it and had let John Sr. in on it.	74
7	1	23	1	They buried Judith next to her husband and had a stone cut for her grave.  	75
7	1	23	2	They went to the church register and delivered the dates of their deaths for each of them during the Sunday service.  	118
7	1	23	3	They returned to the courthouse where an officer returned to the Perkins house with them and oversaw them taking the property willed to each of them. 	150
7	1	23	4	Jacob left his things there and planned his move into the home his father left him. 	84
7	1	23	5	The three sisters split up the kettles, dishes and pots with the three wives of their brothers who were Sarah Perkins, daughter of Robert Pike, Phebe Perkins, daughter of Zaccheus Gould and Elizabeth Perkins daughter of Thomas Lovell.	234
7	1	24	1	Captain Bradbury and Mary took their nine children back with them.  	68
7	1	24	2	Thomas Jr. lead his ewe with a look of sheer delight on his countenance.  	74
7	1	24	3	He had visited his grandparents with enthusiasm in the past and cheerfully accepted their needed chores.  	106
7	1	24	4	Mary was very happy for him.  	30
7	1	24	5	Wymond and Judith were also happy with their time with her.  	61
7	1	24	6	Mary held and looked at baby John in her arms.  	48
7	1	24	7	He was fast asleep, breathing deeply into his swaddling looking very content.	77
7	1	25	1	Salisbury, Massachusetts 1654	29
7	1	26	1	Thomas Bradbury Jr. aka “Tommy” rode to school with Mary, Jane and Jacob to school every day with their father, once Captain, now Schoolmaster Bradbury or Master Bradbury as the school children were wont to call him.  	218
7	1	26	2	The air was nippy and the mornings nearing to first frost. 	59
7	1	26	3	While this was not normally the case, Master Bradbury took over the school and Dame School all at once but keeping some of the curriculum that belong to Mary out of the lessons and teaching both the boys and the girls.  	220
7	1	26	4	Wymond and Judith were busy working while William and the younger ones stayed at home with mother.	98
7	1	27	1	Master Bradbury broke the tedium of class by organizing some recesses as he saw fit and as reward for quiet and he started timing these to no more than half an hour.  	167
7	1	27	2	The building was small and had benches instead of desks.  	58
7	1	27	3	It served as a small meeting house on the Lord’s day.  	55
7	1	27	4	There was a fireplace at one end and all the children had to bring a bundle of sticks while Master Bradbury would bring in a short log.  	137
7	1	27	5	Since there was no bell on the building, he kept one of his own there when it came time to bring the children in.	113
7	1	28	1	Mary and Jane were popular girls at school, they wore simple but clean new clothes and their status as the daughters of the school master were well known.  	156
7	1	28	2	Jacob, or “Jake” was a mischievous and rowdy boy, often requiring his father’s full attention and sometimes receiving the worst of the punishments. 	148
7	1	28	3	Jake’s attention seeking was pronounced.  	42
7	1	28	4	Tommy, on the other hand was very shy, preferring to spend hours studying, even studying things he didn’t have to for his own amusement.  	138
7	1	28	5	He had earned some admiration from his father for it in the beginning but after a while it started to concern him.  	116
7	1	28	6	The boys his age took to talking about him behind his back and observed him out of curiosity. 	94
7	1	28	7	Tommy more than anything wanted to fit in and tried to play with the kids but they would tease him about his walk and his speech and were jealous of him for what seemed like special treatment from father.	204
7	1	29	1	After about three hours, the classroom was finally warm with both the heat of the sun and fireplace.  	102
7	1	29	2	Master Bradbury had just given them a timed quiz and announced the time-up.  	77
7	1	29	3	After the children turned in their work, he dismissed them for a recess.  	74
7	1	29	4	Tommy left the building last.	29
7	1	30	1	Outside, one boy, Robby, a boy one year young was talking to Frederick, “Freddy” about Tommy.	93
7	1	31	1	“Tommy sounds like a sissy.  	29
7	1	31	2	Your heard him?  	17
7	1	31	3	‘I don’t know father.’”, Robby imitated his soft voice.	55
7	1	32	1	“He’s a real odd one.  	23
7	1	32	2	Wouldn’t even look over here when I waved at him.”	50
7	1	33	1	They watched him peeling the bark off a stick.	46
7	1	34	1	The bell rang and Robby and Frederick ran in first and sat down on the bench but spaced themselves so Tommy couldn’t take his seat.  	133
7	1	34	2	When the schoolmaster came in, everyone was seated except Tommy.	64
7	1	35	1	“Tommy please have a seat!”	27
7	1	35	2	, said his father sternly.	26
7	1	36	1	Tommy saw that he was blocked but couldn’t get the words out to ask them to move over or to explain they wouldn’t let him.	122
7	1	37	1	“could you please move over?”	29
7	1	38	1	Finally schoolmaster Bradbury looked over at the boys and they quickly moved over to let him in, grinning smugly over themselves.	129
7	1	39	1	They continued to tease him, sometimes taking his books off the bench and dropping them. 	89
7	1	39	2	When Tommy sat closer to father, (Thomas Sr couldn’t hear him well enough) they took to poking him, and flicking his ears.	122
7	1	40	1	“Look at those big dumb ears on Tommy.”, Freddy said his name in an oafish tone and whispered.	94
7	1	42	1	Headmaster Bradbury saw this as something that would continue.  	64
7	1	42	2	While he couldn’t keep constant watch on Tommy, he disciplined Robby and Freddy by sitting them in the corner as he taught the rest of the boys their math, history, hymns, prayers and writing.  	194
7	1	42	3	Each day, they had to read something either out of the new King James Holy Bible, Anne Bradstreet’s poems from The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America or Fasciculus Chemicus by Arthur Dee. 	192
7	1	42	4	The boys soon waited until recess to tease him.  	49
7	1	42	5	If Tommy spoke, they ridicule him or roll their eyes and wag their heads, “Here he goes again.”  	97
7	1	42	6	They were able to get all the kids, including his own sisters behind his back to laugh at him. 	95
7	1	42	7	Soon, all the kids were refusing him a seat.  	46
7	1	42	8	Headmaster Bradbury gave him a bench all to himself some days or sat the quieter younger girls next to him.	107
7	1	43	1	Tommy went outside one recess and tried to join Joshua, Jeremy and Phillip in a game of hide and seek.  	104
7	1	43	2	Robby and Freddy came up and joined in.  	41
7	1	43	3	When Jeremy closed his eyes and started counting, Robby and Freddy came up to Tommy and acted very pleasantly.	110
7	1	44	1	“Hi Tommy, can we hide with you?”	33
7	1	44	2	, smiled Robby.	15
7	1	45	1	“I don’t want you to see my hiding place.” replied Tommy.	57
7	1	46	1	“We won’t tell anyone.”, promised Freddy, “we wouldn’t betray our new friend.”	78
7	1	47	1	“It’s all well.”, Tommy was finding a big pile of leaves he had gathered earlier that day. 	91
7	1	47	2	It was impossible to find him.	30
7	1	48	1	“Let’s all three of us hide in there Tommy.”	44
7	1	49	1	As Tommy turned his back, Robby grabbed his hands and held him there as Freddy took the tug of war rope line he had been carrying on his arm and tied him up and laughed as Tommy angrily stared at them.  	203
7	1	49	2	Tommy didn’t see the rope on their way out as Freddy has put his jacket over his arm loosely covering it.	105
7	1	50	1	“Tommy, the special son of Headmaster Tommy” gave Robby melodramatically in ridicule.	85
7	1	51	1	“Hahahahaha!”	13
7	1	51	2	, Frederick laughed.	20
7	1	52	1	“HEEEEEELP!”	12
7	1	52	2	, Tommy yelled.	15
7	1	53	1	Robby slugged him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.  	65
7	1	53	2	As Tommy started to scream in pain and yell louder.  	53
7	1	53	3	Freddy took off his sock and stuffed it in his mouth.  	55
7	1	53	4	As Tommy struggled, he tripped fell to the ground hitting his head making Tommy yell through his gag almost as loud as a scream, his face turning red.  	152
7	1	53	5	Freddy and Robby kicked him in turn as Tommy did his best to curl up and struggle out.   	89
7	1	53	6	Tommy twitched and rocked there struggling in his agony.	56
7	1	54	1	“If you rat on us, next time we’ll throw you in the river and tell him the Indians ran off with you.” said Robby.	113
7	1	55	1	Noise in the distance indicated Jeremy was looking for them now.  	66
7	1	55	2	In the distance they could hear, “You can all come back now!”	61
7	1	56	1	“Cover him up.” whispered Robby to Freddy.	42
7	1	57	1	They covered him in the leaves and left him there.	50
7	1	58	1	They diverted Jeremy by running back to the schoolhouse but were caught by him along the way.	93
7	1	59	1	“I looked everywhere for you.” said Jeremy completely unaware of what happened, “That’s a great hiding place.  	111
7	1	59	2	Don’t worry, I caught Phillip first.  	38
7	1	59	3	He’s waiting for you two. 	26
7	1	59	4	Hurry!”	7
7	1	60	1	They ran back, but then Jeremy halted them, “Wait, did either of you see Tommy?”	80
7	1	61	1	They shrugged and shook their heads.	36
7	1	62	1	“Maybe he went back.”	21
7	1	63	1	Back at the playground, Captain Bradbury was keeping a close eye out and not seeing his son come back to the group of boys he was playing with, he got worried. 	160
7	1	63	2	“I’m extending recess..”  	26
7	1	63	3	Cheers were heard from all quarters of the yard by the happily playing adolescents and children. 	97
7	1	63	4	Several girls ran past him apparently playing tag, followed by the girl who was ‘it’.  	87
7	1	63	5	He walked up to the boys and asked them, “Have any of you seen Tommy?”	70
7	1	64	1	“No Headmaster.” they all said in turn.  	41
7	1	64	2	Freddy’s gaze darted nervously as he said it.  	47
7	1	64	3	Robby gave his answer straight face.	36
7	1	65	1	“Frederick, did you see him?”	29
7	1	66	1	“He was playing with us but when we went to look for him, we couldn’t find him.” spoke Robby for him.	101
7	1	67	1	“Yah, he was here before we started. 	37
7	1	67	2	We were just playing hide and go seek.”	39
7	1	68	1	Headmaster Bradbury looked at each of them, looking to see if he could discern any more from their expressions.  	113
7	1	68	2	His eyes were suspiciously glaring at Robby. 	45
7	1	68	3	“I need you to help me find him.”	33
7	1	69	1	“Tommy!”	8
7	1	69	2	, shouted Captain Bradbury going in the direction where Tommy was.	66
7	1	70	1	Robby and Frederick went the opposite direction, “Last time we saw him was over here.”	86
7	1	71	1	Headmaster Bradbury headed over there to humor them still suspicious.  	71
7	1	71	2	“Tommy!”	8
7	1	71	3	, he walked further.  	22
7	1	71	4	“Tommy!” 	9
7	1	71	5	he shouted it a few times louder.  	35
7	1	71	6	He turned around going back to the school yard, went in and grabbed the bell and came out ringing it.	101
7	1	72	1	“Listen up young scholars.  	28
7	1	72	2	I need you to help me find Tommy.”	34
7	1	73	1	As the children all looked around at each other, the headmaster continued “I’ll reward anyone who finds him.”	109
7	1	74	1	Robby mouthed a “no” to Freddy and shook his head ever so slightly as Freddy looked over at him.	96
7	1	75	1	Headmaster Bradbury split them up into pairs. 	46
7	1	75	2	“You two, head towards the trees north.”, “You two west towards the glen.” and so on. 	86
7	1	75	3	He saw them go off looking and walking in pairs.  	50
7	1	75	4	The two going to the trees walked past the leaves but thought it might be a small animal like a raccoon or fox.  	113
7	1	75	5	They went back and reported.	28
7	1	76	1	“We couldn’t find him.  	24
7	1	76	2	It’s dark and there are wild animals out there.”	48
7	1	77	1	“Go back and look again.” replied the headmaster.  	51
7	1	77	2	This happened a couple times more.	34
7	1	78	1	Jeremy was one of the young kids who went towards the trees.  	62
7	1	78	2	He looked on the ground and saw a lot of tracks.  	50
7	1	78	3	Mary, Tommy’s sister was with him.  	36
7	1	78	4	Jeremy asked her, “Did Tommy say anything to you?  	51
7	1	78	5	Do you think he went this way?”	31
7	1	78	6	, barely giving Mary a chance to answer anything.	49
7	1	79	1	“He did not say anything.  	27
7	1	79	2	Those look like his shoe size.” she replied.	44
7	1	80	1	As they came up to the leaf pile again, Jeremy gave it a more serious look and caught sight of Tommy’s  feet sticking out and a noise coming from under it.  	157
7	1	80	2	As they uncovered him, they gasped.  	37
7	1	80	3	He was tied up and thrashing, eyes closed and looking a mix of reds and purples.  	82
7	1	80	4	Mary looked on in shock as Jeremy hurried to ungag and untie him.	65
7	1	81	1	“Gadzoons! 	11
7	1	81	2	Holy mother! 	13
7	1	81	3	What happened to you?” 	23
7	1	81	4	asked Jeremy.	13
7	1	82	1	Thomas’ eyes were closed.  	27
7	1	82	2	He was deliriously still thrashing. 	36
7	1	82	3	Jeremy shouted, “We found him! 	31
7	1	82	4	Hurry quickly!”	15
7	1	83	1	Captain Bradbury was furious.  	31
7	1	83	2	“Who did this to …”, seeing his son there looking out of his usual color and condition, he picked him up and tried to set him on his feet, patting him.  	153
7	1	83	3	Tommy couldn’t stand but lost the ruddy color in his face.  	60
7	1	83	4	He held him up in his arm.  	28
7	1	83	5	Jeremy explained how he had come across him buried, gagged and tied up and how they untied him pointing to the rope on the ground.	130
7	1	84	1	He carried him back to the school yard and yelled “School is dismissed!”	72
7	1	84	2	, “Mary, douse the hearth fire and close the door and catch up with me!” 	73
7	1	84	3	he yelled going through his school closing routine as quickly in his head as possible.. 	88
7	1	84	4	He carried him towards home, Mary and Jane soon caught up with him.  	69
7	1	84	5	As they approached the house, Mary was waiting there.	53
7	1	85	1	“Good Mother of Christ, what happened to Tommy?”	48
7	1	86	1	“I think one or more of the boys that tease him.  	50
7	1	86	2	I have to have a talk with their parents or expel those students, regardless of their payment, I’ll return their rate fees if I have to.  	138
7	1	86	3	I think I know who did it.”	27
7	1	87	1	Mary took Thomas in her arms and noticed his head lump.  	57
7	1	87	2	“I think he has taken a concussion to his head.  	49
7	1	87	3	I’ll get his swelling down.  	29
7	1	87	4	Mary rummaged through her boxes of salves and bandage cloths.  	63
7	1	87	5	She took some water on a cloth and put it on his head and tried to get him to come to.	86
7	1	88	1	Tommy moaned and groaned in pain, rocking and starting to cry loudly once again. 	81
7	1	88	2	Mary patiently waited it out before talking to him. 	52
7	1	88	3	Tommy went to sleep after Mary gave him some brandy to sedate him along with some herbals used for sleep.	105
7	1	89	1	Schoolmaster Bradbury went back to school the next day to conduct business and inquire of the incident but no one was forthcoming.  	132
7	1	89	2	He was not able to dismiss anyone based on his hunches.	55
7	1	90	1	Mary watched over Tommy as he lay there at home resting under her care and in between her much child tending.  	111
7	1	90	2	Jacob, William and Elizabeth were always fighting and getting into difficult mishaps themselves.  	98
7	1	90	3	Mary had been watching the mothers at the local meetinghouse and had picked up their stern and correcting tones.  	114
7	1	90	4	She believed it would be easier when they were older if they learned some of the hard disciplines when younger or at the age of speaking.  	139
7	1	90	5	After she set the children to work together, she went back to Tommy to see how he was doing.  	94
7	1	90	6	He was awake now, one of his eyes drooping a little.	52
7	1	91	1	A tear came to Mary’s eye as she realized how horribly he felt and how she realized he was being bullied.  	107
7	1	91	2	Tommy held her tightly.	23
7	1	92	1	“Tommy, can you tell me what happened?”	39
7	1	93	1	Tommy looked at her scared to speak, stuttering through his fear.	65
7	1	94	1	“Please, tell me.”	18
7	1	95	1	“Why does everyone hate me?” 	29
7	1	95	2	he asked.	9
7	1	96	1	“Everyone doesn’t hate you.” she replied.	41
7	1	97	1	“I mean, at school, the kids there.  	37
7	1	97	2	They all hate me.  	19
7	1	97	3	What did I ever do to them?”	28
7	1	98	1	Mary looked at him, deep in thought wondering the same thing herself, she never thought of her son Tommy as one to inflict harm on others.  	140
7	1	98	2	He was very docile and gentle.  	32
7	1	98	3	She knew it would be a bad idea to tell him he failed to stand up for himself. 	79
7	1	98	4	It would only make him feel more like he failed.	48
7	1	99	1	“You will be doing the right thing by telling me who did this Tommy.  	70
7	1	99	2	Don’t worry, I will protect you.  	34
7	1	99	3	I will also start teaching you myself.”	39
7	1	100	1	“It was Robby and Freddy.”	26
7	1	101	1	“Good Tommy.  	14
7	1	101	2	You are courageous to tell me.  	32
7	1	101	3	I can’t say nothing bad will happen again.  	44
7	1	101	4	That’s part of life.  	22
7	1	101	5	But it won’t bad like this.”, in her mind she swore to herself that she’d keep him safe.	88
7	1	102	1	Tommy and Mary went to school together after getting Squaw Mercy  to watch her children.  	90
7	1	102	2	She broke through the aisle of the room.  	42
7	1	102	3	It was separated into boys and girls.  	39
7	1	102	4	Robby and Freddy looked nervously wide eyes but soon turned to scowl in threat at Tommy.	88
7	1	103	1	“Can I have a word with you headmaster?”	40
7	1	104	1	“Recess!”	9
7	1	104	2	, the children started to file out.	35
7	1	105	1	Mary took him aside out of view.  	34
7	1	105	2	Robby and Freddy stayed behind to listen and sure enough, they heard Mary give their names. 	92
7	1	105	3	Robby took a well of ink in his hand and stood up looking angry at Tommy.	73
7	1	106	1	“You snitched on us didn’t you.” said Robby as he approached.	61
7	1	107	1	“You remember what we were going to do to you?”	47
7	1	107	2	, said Freddy.	14
7	1	108	1	Robby moved in close as Tommy yelled “MOMMMMM!”	47
7	1	109	1	Robby put his hands in the ink and rubbed his hands all through Tommy’s face and hair.  	88
7	1	109	2	“There, now you look like the rat you are.” he said with an clenched anger in his brow and gritted teeth and he pushed him back smartly.  	138
7	1	109	3	Freddy pulled and messed up the ink in his hair.  	50
7	1	109	4	Mary could be heard stepping quickly and opening the door.  	60
7	1	109	5	Freddy and Robby ran.  	23
7	1	109	6	Mary realized she left him alone and was quick to try and correct that but as she opened the door, she was too late. 	117
7	1	109	7	They had just taken off running and laughing knowing Mary would not be able to catch them.  	92
7	1	109	8	Headmaster Bradbury soon followed and seeing Tommy, he was incensed.  	70
7	1	109	9	Tommy broke into tears again sobbing.	37
7	1	110	1	“I’ll kill those bastards!” 	28
7	1	110	2	yelled the headmaster.  	24
7	1	110	3	All the children came inside to find out what all the commotion was about.  	76
7	1	110	4	The children started to laugh at Tommy.  	41
7	1	110	5	Headmaster Bradbury turned to stare at the children with a look they knew not to mess with.  	93
7	1	110	6	“There will be no recess for the rest of the week.” he said calmly, “Instead, I’m going to have you sing together indoors.”  	125
7	1	110	7	One small groan from one of the younger boys could be heard...he stopped mid-breath however when Headmaster Bradbury looked at him.  	133
7	1	110	8	“We will be copying what I write here on my board, one hundred times.”	70
7	1	111	1	I will not laugh at another’s misfortune.	41
7	1	112	1	Mary looked at Tom, and never saw him this angry before.  	58
7	1	112	2	Thomas paced a bit then turned to look at Tommy and sternly told it to him: “I’m going to teach you how to fight if it’s the last thing I do.  	143
7	1	112	3	Next time they do that, I want you to give it to them.” then he told the rest of the class, “I am going to step out but if I see anyone out of their seat or not writing, you will get the board.”	194
7	1	113	1	Mary and Tom went out of the classroom and headed into an argument, one of the loudest arguments Tommy had ever seen them have.	127
7	1	114	1	“I have to get back to teaching, go back with Thomas and get him cleaned up.”	77
7	1	115	1	Tommy’s white shirt was stained and his hair was stained black and unwashed.  	78
7	1	115	2	Mary got him into a bath and scrubbed his face gently until the ink came off. 	78
7	1	115	3	When father came home, he told Mary and Thomas both with all the other children listening, “Those boys will not be coming back to our schoolhouse again.”	153
7	1	116	1	Mary schooled Tommy at home the rest of that year. 	51
7	1	116	2	She noticed he was becoming very adept at herbs, weaving, spinning threads, churning butter and taking care of the other children and their skinned knees, splinters and arms.  	176
7	1	116	3	His youngest sisters loved him dearly. 	39
7	1	116	4	Mary had already seen Tommy’s head-turning at other boys older than him at church.  	84
7	1	116	5	He stared at the ones with handsome mustaches, the same ones she might stare at when she was younger.	101
7	1	117	1	After church one day, Mary talked to him as her oldest Judith took care of the children for her and took Thomas upstairs alone to the place where Thomas worked and spun the wool.  	180
7	1	117	2	She called down to Judith, “Don’t let anyone else come up here.”	64
7	1	118	1	“Thomas Junior.”	16
7	1	119	1	“Yes mother?”	13
7	1	120	1	“I know your father talked to you about the birds and bees last year.  	71
7	1	120	2	There’s probably something he didn’t mention. …  first, let me ask you something.”	82
7	1	121	1	“Do you fancy any of the maidens at the meeting?”	49
7	1	122	1	“I guess so.”	13
7	1	123	1	“I know you’re young and not expected to suit these ladies yet, but something tells me you’re not going to.”	108
7	1	124	1	“Why do you say that mother?”	29
7	1	125	1	“Tommy, who do you really fancy?  	34
7	1	125	2	You don’t have to tell me ladies here.”	39
7	1	126	1	Tommy blushed a little bit.  	29
7	1	126	2	“I ..”, he cleared his throat as he tried to get it out. “, I know it’s strange.  	82
7	1	126	3	I don’t think I’m supposed to feel this.  	42
7	1	126	4	I find Samuel to be the most beautiful man I know. 	51
7	1	126	5	His eyes make me melt, and when he looks at me, I get butterflies. 	67
7	1	126	6	I can’t help but spy him when he’s not looking at me.  	55
7	1	126	7	I’m sorry mother.”	18
7	1	127	1	“Tommy, I saw it myself.  	26
7	1	127	2	Do not be sorry	15
7	1	127	3	.	1
7	1	127	4	”,	2
7	1	128	1	“I can’t ..”	12
7	1	129	1	“Tommy, the first thing you have to learn is that you should find someone...someone who has the same tastes you do. 	116
7	1	129	2	Do you understand?”	19
7	1	130	1	“Yes Mother.”	13
7	1	131	1	“You also should take time to get to know your friends and when you find a special friend, take your time, look for several of them. 	133
7	1	131	2	Find the one who you know is for you.  	39
7	1	131	3	I am the one who should be sorry.”	34
7	1	132	1	“Sorry for what Mother?”	24
7	1	133	1	“Sorry for what I cannot give to you.  	39
7	1	133	2	Our society, does not look as kindly upon on such people and it is a wickedness to them.”, Thomas looked downcast but she continued, “But you are my son, and this is not a wickedness to me.  	191
7	1	133	3	It would be more of a transgression if you were to try and suit someone’s daughter.  	85
7	1	133	4	Your calling is different.  	28
7	1	133	5	Your calling is to nature Herself.  	36
7	1	133	6	You have gifts of her spirit and will be able to work her marvels. 	67
7	1	133	7	While your love is something you must keep away from the view of others, you must abide the same rules of being fair and devoted and just like others like the friend of a friend I once knew, you can keep your home matters to yourself and live your calling.  	258
7	1	133	8	Perhaps you will not be a father but you will help children of our blood who have no one else to guide them.  	110
7	1	133	9	Your hands will be free to help whomever comes to you for aid.  	64
7	1	133	10	You will be a father to the fatherless in this way even though you will be father to none, you are also father to all, like our dear Lord.”	139
7	1	134	1	“Tonight, I will share with you what my mother shared with me.”, said Mary to Tommy. 	85
7	1	134	2	Mary sounded like her own mother then and there in her memory even though she had already given Judith the test and was planning on testing her grandchildren some day if she lived long enough.  	194
7	1	134	3	She gave him the same introduction and initiation that her mother Judith had given her except telling him that he would be a great Prince instead.	146
7	1	135	1	“First, I give you your magic wand.  	37
7	1	135	2	You can create anything you want with this.”, she handed Thomas an ink pen with a long wooden handle.	101
7	1	136	1	Thomas looked at it and then at her confused, “This….is a wand?  	65
7	1	136	2	How ….”	7
7	1	137	1	“Just listen, how to use it will become clear soon enough, but for your first test of magic, I would like you to summon a seagull.  	132
7	1	137	2	The best seagull you can.”  	28
7	1	137	3	Thomas Jr. paused a second  and then realized what was he was being asked to do.  	82
7	1	137	4	He got a piece of parchment out on his hornbook and started to draw.	68
7	1	138	1	Mary inspected his drawing.  	29
7	1	138	2	It was most beautiful and even had the detail she was looking for.  	68
7	1	138	3	He didn’t draw all of it realistically but it captured the personality almost cartoonishly.  	93
7	1	138	4	The abstract minor details he left out but the identifying ones and markings of import like the red on its bill he purposefully drew.  	135
7	1	138	5	He added the shadows and it seemed to have life to it as that of one captured in the mind’s eye mid-flight.	107
7	1	139	1	She reviewed his drawing with him and put it away safely and finished off with the standard warnings, “There’s one last thing I must tell you.  	144
7	1	139	2	That is, tell no one, no one except myself and those I grant you to tell it to.  	81
7	1	139	3	These will be of our family who have the gifts first and foremost, and those friends and mates of yours who are pleasing to me and you will tell them the same way I told you: Tonight, I will share with you what my mother shared with me.”	237
7	1	140	1	From that day forth, Tommy shed his childhood nickname and asked to be called “Tom” or “Junior”.  	98
7	1	140	2	He continued to be a beacon to bullies but they never lasted long enough to do him any harm.  	94
7	1	140	3	People still insinuated about him and treated him less than the other men in the public sphere but in his home life, he was valued and held in high esteem for his wisdom and knowledge and miraculous ability to work any craft and especially, to make finery, costumes and threads of the finest quality, imbued with a magic only he seemed to know.  	346
7	1	140	4	His charm as a gentleman would later be well renowned despite his status as the perennial bachelor and somewhat of a play boy.	126
7	1	141	1	Mary’s motherhood was starting to wear her down.  	50
7	1	141	2	Now in her forties, she woke up in aches and pains on the sides she rested on.  	80
7	1	141	3	Not only did she care for her own but she was a wet nurse, midwife, healer and teacher for others.  	100
7	1	141	4	The Dame School often felt like a day care.  	45
7	1	141	5	While Mary’s reputation for her medical success and treatment of smallpox caught the attention of all the great physics and doctors, she wondered if that was the end of her influence.  	185
7	1	141	6	The day to day grind forced her to delegate much of her work to Wymond and Judith. 	83
7	1	141	7	Mary was going to now have another child who she named Ann but without the e.	77
7	1	142	1	Two years after that, she had her final baby, a boy she named Jabez as the toils of motherhood were taking their toll on her entire body.  	139
7	1	142	2	Just as she was feeding Jabez, Ann fell sick.  	47
7	1	142	3	Judith her daughter was at a loss to save her despite the excellent teaching Mary gave her.  	93
7	1	142	4	Ann passed away at the tender age of three.	43
7	1	143	1	Mary’s heart was broken.  	26
7	1	143	2	Major Robert Pike, a good friend of Captain Bradbury during his time as a military leader, came by to offer condolences.  	122
7	1	143	3	Captain Bradbury had served as second in command as an ensign to him in the local militia.  	92
7	1	143	4	The Bradbury’s admired Major Pike’s eloquent and soft voice yet firm resolve.  	79
7	1	143	5	Major Pike was also a man of sympathy towards people of other faiths like the many Quakers who fled mother England to arrive here and escape persecution in recent years.  	171
7	1	143	6	While most people reviled Quakers, the Bradbury and Pike families were tolerant and even sympathetic to them and were even inspired by their views of having a personal and non-dogmatic view of deity and creation.  	214
7	1	143	7	Major Pike was about Mary’s age, yet Captain Thomas had looked up to Major Pike because of the fine upbringing of his children and Major PIke’s own father, John Pike who had died only a few years ago.  	202
7	1	143	8	John Pike was like a father to the entire town of Salisbury.  	62
7	1	143	9	It was for this that Captain Bradbury lived vicariously through Robert and they spent much time in the courts as well handling land deeds.  	140
7	1	143	10	They spoke to each other at the same level.  	45
7	1	143	11	Major Pike had many beautiful daughters, very young but the oldest Sarah was just a few years younger than Mary’s son Wymond.	125
7	1	144	1	As Sarah had been taught in their home many times, Wymond became fond of Sarah and while there were potential suitors, Wymond was already first in line and began to woo her as soon as it was clear she could start having gentlemen call on her to date. 	251
7	1	144	2	Wymond had played “Jack” Valentine for the Feast of St. 	56
7	1	144	3	Valentine for the past five years handing her sweets.  	55
7	1	144	4	They married in May of 1661.	28
7	1	146	1	Ipswich, 1655 to 1659	21
7	1	147	1	Just outside of Salisbury, on a three acre parcel of corn plantation sat a landing with a ferry docked there.  	111
7	1	147	2	Across the river, a great home sat atop an island known in Ipswich as “Carr Island”, after its owner George, who now gated the river owning both sides of it.  	159
7	1	147	3	Five years ago, he saw Captain Thomas Bradbury who had written the order for the construction of the bridge granting George the ownership of the operation on conditions.  	171
7	1	147	4	It was a tall order requiring clearance on all sides of the bridge so as to safely accommodate passengers, cargo and horses.  	126
7	1	147	5	George was relishing that he now had nearly exclusive control.  	64
7	1	147	6	The capital and labor required for building the floating bridge of the dimensions given in the decree were hard to come by.  	125
7	1	147	7	The work progress slowly until the summer of 1655 when the bridge was nearly completed, opposition to the effort was encountered by a petition to the General Court that outlined the dangers that could result from the obstruction such a bridge would be to passing vessels on the river.  	286
7	1	147	8	The court then passed an order to answer the petition made by the citizens of Salisbury to set aside times for navigation so they could transport animal feed.	158
7	1	148	1	“Elizabeth!”	12
7	1	149	1	George now fifty-six had married Elizabeth Dexter now thirty-two some fourteen years ago. 	90
7	1	149	2	He being more tired in his age and hard at his work was delighted to have found a young eighteen year old girl who could take care of his children, now seven of them at home.	174
7	1	150	1	“Yes George?”	13
7	1	151	1	“We’ve just completed the bridge.  	35
7	1	151	2	I will be getting our townsmen of Ipswich together to inspect it and report on it.  	84
7	1	151	3	I think there will be no troubles getting it certified by them.  	65
7	1	151	4	I told them I’d be entertaining them here after they look at it and give it a test ride.”	89
7	1	152	1	Elizabeth was followed by her two sons, Richard and James into their kitchen.	77
7	1	153	1	The floating bridge carried a retinue of attendants on horseback for the presiding magistrate of the court of old Norfolk county.	129
7	1	155	1	Sure enough, they signed a statement that the bridge was fully sufficient for the safe passage of both men and horses.  	120
7	1	155	2	Given the petition that added to his burden, the certificate was further worded that the earnings of all other ferries now belong to George and that any competing ferries must cease unless employed by said George Carr for his use and control. 	243
7	1	155	3	It was signed by judge Samuel Symonds.	38
7	1	156	1	Five years later, the court exempted the bridge from taxes and George was granted one hundred and fifty more acres and was able to fend off his competitors from regaining control for a time. 	191
7	1	156	2	However, being that this grand floating bridge became the sole source of transportation and as demand for it grew during further settlement, it soon became a very sore bottleneck and a demand George didn’t care to cater to out of his own sense of total and absolute power in this situation.  	292
7	1	156	3	The increased demand ensured he had a monopoly and could charge handsomely over or under the table for whatever deal he wanted.	127
7	1	157	1	Boston, Spring 1660	19
7	1	158	1	A man in a black mask sat in a damp cave, his hair flowing out from behind it.  	80
7	1	158	2	A new slave girl from Africa sat on one side of him and an assembly of ladies both old and young and a few men, and slaves sat in front of him. 	144
7	1	158	3	Endicott	8
7	1	159	1	“Mary Dyer, mother of our sacrifice has returned to Boston and become an annoyance, contending against our seats of power.  	124
7	1	159	2	The time is ripe for her removal.”	34
7	1	160	1	A crowd of black robes rose in cheers.  	40
7	1	160	2	“Blood for our Prince!” 	24
7	1	160	3	the chanted.	12
7	1	161	1	Mary Dyer had been staying at Shelter Island for the past few years in the comfort of other Quaker refugees.  	110
7	1	161	2	Given the convictions and outrage at the actions of the Puritans in excusing their awful treatment towards the Quakers, Ms. 	124
7	1	161	3	Dyer had resolved to return to Boston, redeeming herself and going like a lamb to the slaughter as she saw it in similitude of her Lord and in defense of the freedom of her conscience and the conscience of others like her.  	224
7	1	161	4	She was soon arrested as was the law in Boston for violating her exile.  	73
7	1	161	5	On the last day of May, she was sat before the old John Endicott resting lazily above her against the wooden supports as he gazed down at her looking upon her in disgust, his tongue smacked his lips before he started his interrogation.	235
7	1	162	1	“Are you the same Mary Dyer that was here before?”	50
7	1	163	1	”I am the same Mary Dyer that was here the last General Court”	62
7	1	164	1	“You will own yourself a Quaker, will you not?”	47
7	1	165	1	“I own myself to be reproachfully so called.”	45
7	1	166	1	“Sentence was passed upon you the last General Court; and now likewise--You must return to the prison, and there remain till to-morrow at nine o'clock; then thence you must go to the gallows and there be hanged till you are dead.”	230
7	1	167	1	“This is no more than what thou saidst before.”	47
7	1	168	1	“But now it is to be executed. 	31
7	1	168	2	Therefore prepare yourself to-morrow at nine o'clock.”	54
7	1	169	1	“I came in obedience to the will of God the last General Court, desiring you to repeal your unrighteous laws of banishment on pain of death; and that same is my work now, and earnest request, although I told you that if you refused to repeal them, the Lord would send others of his servants to witness against them.”	316
7	1	170	1	“Do you own yourself a prophetess too?”	39
7	1	171	1	“I speak the words that the Lord speaks to me.”	47
7	1	172	1	“Do you intend to speak here?” 	31
7	1	172	2	and he lowered his eyes and brows down at her glaring and waiting for her to defy him.	86
7	1	173	1	“The Lord’s will is my sacrifice will open....”	47
7	1	174	1	She continued to speak no one heard her over the loud and furious voice of John Endicott, “Away with her!  	107
7	1	174	2	Away with her now!”	19
7	1	175	1	The next day, at nine of the clock in the morning, Mary Dyer was escorted by an executioner and towed but with a slack cord as she went willingly to the gallows.  	163
7	1	175	2	As he bade her to climb the ladder under the elm tree,	54
7	1	176	1	Endicott asked her in his smug smirking way seeing he might make himself look bad he tried to put on the airs of being merciful: “Out of mercy, I will ask you one time.  	170
7	1	176	2	Will you accept my offer to to return to exile with the other..other...heretical lunatics of your kind and spare your own life?”	128
7	1	177	1	"Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord God I came, and in his will I abide faithful to the death."	116
7	1	178	1	The military commander, Captain John Webb, took over reading the charges: “For the wicked crime of heresy and for the conspiracy to destroy the church from within under the foul influence of the Devil, “ and so on saying how she was guilty of her own blood and not anyone else’s and how this was well deserved punishment and just how bad the Quakers were.  	357
7	1	178	2	He then asked, to which John Endicott rolled his eyes and looked away, “Do you have any last words, Mary Dyer?” 	112
7	1	178	3	in his most officious voice.	28
7	1	179	1	Mary replied: “Nay, I came to keep bloodguiltiness from you, desiring you to repeal the unrighteous and unjust law of banishment upon pain of death, made against the innocent servants of the Lord, therefore my blood will be required at your hands who willfully do it; but for those that do is in the simplicity of their hearts, I do desire the Lord to forgive them. 	366
7	1	179	2	I came to do the will of my Father, and in obedience to his will I stand even to the death.”	92
7	1	180	1	Captain Webb, hesitant asked, “Anyone else?”	44
7	1	180	2	, which started Endicott boiling under his collar but showing restraint in public view, he impatiently waited tapping his foot and fingers.	139
7	1	181	1	Mary’s former pastor, John Wilson, stepped up, trying to get her to change her mind, “I urge you Mary to repent and to not be so deluded and carried away by the deceit of the devil!"	182
7	1	182	1	Mary answered, "Nay, man, I am not now to repent."	50
7	1	183	1	Pastor Wilson continued, “Would you at least have the elders pray for your soul?”	81
7	1	184	1	Mary then replied, "I know never an Elder here."	48
7	1	185	1	Pastor Wilson then started to speak, “Your friends here, can they pray for your soul by their own free will?”	109
7	1	186	1	John Endicott tapped Captain Webb with an angry look now reddening his face and motioned with his finger to give the order.	123
7	1	187	1	Mary had barely spoke when Captain Webb signaled the order, she got out the words “My Friends ah….”	99
7	1	188	1	The executioner tipped the ladder thus swinging her off and she made a squeak and choke.  	90
7	1	188	2	She kicked the air a few minutes.  	35
7	1	188	3	Several people looked around about to take off their hats and seemingly confused about what to do since it had been a good seasons since the last hanging.	154
7	1	189	1	Mary’s friends in Portsmouth, Rhode Island wrote of her:	56
7	1	190	1	Mary Dyer the wife of William Dyer of Newport in Rhode Island: she was put to death at the Town of Boston with ye like cruel hand as the martyrs were in Queen Mary's time, and there buried upon ye 31 day of ye 3d mo. 1660."	223
7	1	191	1	In those days, the calendar used at the time had May as the third month of the year, but the date in the record is incorrect by a day since the actual date of death was 1 June.  	178
7	1	191	2	Whether they did this out of their own lunar calendar practice or intentionally or by accident, no one knows any more.	118
7	1	192	1	In that year, there were more public preachings and whippings and five executions all dying the same way poor Mary Dyer did.  	126
7	1	192	2	Mary lamented to Thomas about what she could possible do for these poor Quakers.  	82
7	1	192	3	Committed more than ever, Mary sought to covertly assist them whenever she could.  	83
7	1	192	4	In the May of 1661, the Pike family put together one of the most beautiful weddings to ever take place in Salisbury sealing the alliance between the Bradburys and the Pike family.	179
7	1	193	1	In the winter of 1662, three more Quaker women arrived in Dover, New Hampshire, preaching for a time but then arrested and sentenced to be whipped publicly.  	158
7	1	193	2	The magistrate there being the dutiful tool of Boston arranged by Endicott, made a show of his authority by issuing a warrant that decreed that all  the the constables of eleven surrounding towns, including Salisbury, were to carry out public whippings of the three women. 	273
7	1	193	3	They were transported in a cart to Salisbury, the third town of the eleven.  	77
7	1	193	4	When they arrived, they came upon Captain Thomas Bradbury, Robert Pike and Walter Barefoote.	92
7	1	194	1	The constable spoke to them, “I’m here by order of Richard Waldron, magistrate of Dover and by the most Honorable John Endicott to have these three Quaker women publicly whipped here at your town square, please gather your citizens together.  	243
7	1	194	2	If you do not comply, I have authority to arrest you too.”	58
7	1	195	1	Robert Pike replied, “I’m the constable here. 	46
7	1	195	2	Bring out your detainees for us to inspect.”	44
7	1	196	1	The constable brought them out in their bilboes and chains.	59
7	1	197	1	“Captain Bradbury, please read the papers of the good constable.”	65
7	1	198	1	Captain Bradbury knew that this was to restrain the fat constable should he protest.	84
7	1	199	1	“Walter Barefoote, I hereby grant you power as deputy.”	55
7	1	200	1	Walter Barefoote then promptly released them all as Captain Bradbury restrained the constable who protested.	108
7	1	201	1	“You do not have authority to do that!”	39
7	1	202	1	“I have authority to deputize anyone I so wish.  	49
7	1	202	2	I did not order my deputy to release them.  	44
7	1	202	3	I believe my deputy has merely misused his authority, I’ve seen that happen before in Dover.  	94
7	1	202	4	Worry not, I will soon correct him.”	36
7	1	203	1	“Walter, bad deputy!  	22
7	1	203	2	I hereby release you.”	22
7	1	204	1	Using the loophole Major Pike found would not jeopardize Walter since he was like an ambassador with a tribe the colonists were trying to be on good terms with.	160
7	1	205	1	“You’ll pay for that!”	22
7	1	206	1	“There will be no such thing.  	31
7	1	206	2	You have no power here.  	25
7	1	206	3	Be off.”	8
7	1	207	1	The women stayed with Mary Bradbury and helped her with her many children which she tended.  	93
7	1	207	2	Mary was worried they’d just go preaching again and get themselves arrested all over again.  	93
7	1	207	3	She encouraged them in wisdom that they should find those first that were in a quandary of which way to go first to preach there but to agree with the adversary while in the way with him so they could more effectively deliver their message.	240
7	1	208	1	“You’ll be no use to the Lord if you’re captured again.  	57
7	1	208	2	You can’t preach in bonds and no one admires the suffering.  	61
7	1	208	3	Be patient and gentle as doves and wise as pythons as the good book would say.” she said persuasively.	102
7	1	209	1	They heard her out and thanked her for the mercy shown to them.  	65
7	1	209	2	While Captain Bradbury freely gave them transportation to wherever they wished, they were given passage to a midway point and left to walk the paths they decided on as was their way.  	184
7	1	209	3	Mary had assumed that they were no longer heard from as suffering further capture and so was contented with that. 	114
7	1	209	4	To be sure, Mary had taken written them a special letter sealed as she had learned from her spell books.  	106
7	1	209	5	The letters contained a blessing with a foreword giving it to them by name:	75
7	1	210	1	By the power of our Lord and our Lady, Father and Mother on High. 	66
7	1	210	2	By the Father Son and Holy Ghost, and their Goodwives each.  	61
7	1	210	3	By Peter James and John. 	25
7	1	210	4	By the Mary three.  	20
7	1	210	5	Blessed are ye. 	16
7	1	210	6	(here was written a seal)	25
7	1	211	1	The evil eye shall not watch thee.  	36
7	1	211	2	The spying eye will not find thee.  	36
7	1	211	3	The scrying glass will cloud for thee.  	40
7	1	211	4	An unbreakable shield come between thee and any calamity until the day of your departure from this world cometh as written in ye Booke of Life.  	145
7	1	211	5	May the Good Lord grant me, fore-bearing my unclean hand and filthy paper to inscribe for thee my wish in his Book.  	117
7	1	211	6	Thy servant Mary, ordained to serve thee forever and ever. 	59
7	1	211	7	Amen.	5
7	1	212	1	x	1
7	1	213	1	Ipswich 1668	12
7	1	214	1	With that, the women went on their way and were not harmed again.	65
7	1	215	1	A man in a black mask sat in a damp cave, the lightning shone upon the rain outside.  	86
7	1	215	2	He was  surrounded by a dozen others.  	39
7	1	215	3	He stood up this time to speak, “Her entire family, this Bradbury family and this Pike family have thwarted me enough and derailed us this time.  	146
7	1	215	4	These Quakers threaten to destroy our stronghold and everything else we hold dear.  	84
7	1	215	5	Our traditions will not be mocked.  	36
7	1	215	6	Her simplest acts bring us down like a pillar of kettles.  	59
7	1	215	7	You have all of you let me down.  	34
7	1	215	8	I will let none of you back in until you fulfil my next design upon her.  	74
7	1	215	9	Alice, Batilde, step forward and bare to me your hands.”	56
7	1	216	1	They took an oath and received devices and information to set up Mary’s family directly this time in the recess he had curtained off there.  	141
7	1	216	2	He then came back with them, both women bloody handed and stripped bare.  	74
7	1	216	3	A large clamoring of voices started to rise but his first words silenced them quickly:	86
7	1	217	1	“See what I will do for those who serve.  	42
7	1	217	2	Also see what I will do to those who do not.”	45
7	1	218	1	He unveiled a table having skulls still pink from recent deaths.  	66
7	1	218	2	As he did, a rats scurried away from the torchlight.  	54
7	1	218	3	Only gasps were heard now.  	28
7	1	218	4	He took a torch and lit a fat and oil soaked fire.  	52
7	1	218	5	It flamed up high.  	20
7	1	218	6	More gasps were heard.  	24
7	1	218	7	What happened next would split the air with the sound of screams prefaced by spiteful and angry hectoring, tearful pleading and followed by loud maniacal laughter full of arrogant mockery at someone’s demise.	208
7	1	219	1	Mary’s son Jacob had taken an adventure to West Africa.  	57
7	1	219	2	He had been late reaching her.  	32
7	1	219	3	Mary feared the worst and sure enough, word came back that Jacob had died there.  	82
7	1	219	4	From what they never said consistently.  	41
7	1	219	5	Mary was in mourning and soul-searching. 	41
7	1	219	6	The loss of her son Jacob was too much to bear.  	49
7	1	219	7	Her family wept bitterly for him. 	34
7	1	219	8	He had died without issue or love at the tender age of twenty one.	66
7	1	220	1	Mary’s little brother Jacob, now forty-four years old, came knocking on the Bradbury residence door with his dainty wife Elizabeth and six children in tow.  	157
7	1	220	2	They all had similar names so that Mary, in her age got confused with all the similar names like Judith, Elizabeth, John and Jacob.  	133
7	1	220	3	She used their full names and still got confused since they reminded her so much of her own family members.  	109
7	1	220	4	Thankfully, Mary’s three oldest daughters were not around and Jacob provided her with nicknames.  	98
7	1	220	5	Judith, Mary and Jane had all recently been married.  	54
7	1	220	6	Wymond’s wife Sarah was now expecting their third child after having two girls. 	80
7	1	220	7	Wymond was expecting a boy and would name him after himself if it came true.  	78
7	1	220	8	Mary offered them all tea and crackers in gracious hostess style and had a meal started.  	90
7	1	220	9	Jacob was flustered and after a brief consolation for the loss of Jacob, Mary’s son, he brought to her notice the real reason for his visit..	141
7	1	221	1	“Mary, I really must now tell you what happened this past week if you do not already know.”	91
7	1	222	1	To Mary, this seemed like a huge load to take on coming up.	59
7	1	223	1	“I’m so sorry dear brother.  	29
7	1	223	2	I will sit down while the water’s boiling.  	44
7	1	223	3	Do continue your accounting.”	29
7	1	224	1	Jacob started quickly dropping the word “Fire.” which concerned Mary greatly so much that she had to ask him to start over.	123
7	1	225	1	“The home we settled into as youths in Ipswich has been much improved on over the years thanks to the bountiful increases the Lord has bestowed upon us.  	154
7	1	225	2	Father had improved it further after your good husband took your hand and left me with a large estate to manage.  	114
7	1	225	3	For this purpose I employed help as could be found from around Ipswich, some who are fair with us and others, who I do believe do not have our welfare at heart.  	162
7	1	225	4	We have suffered a great fire where many of our family’s properties as heirs and assigns were damaged or fully consumed.”	121
7	1	226	1	“How did that happen?” 	23
7	1	226	2	asked a shocked Mary.	21
7	1	227	1	“We had left for town to do our business and sell our first harvests and left our maidservant, Mehitable or Meddy Brabrook of now marrying age was taken with much smoking from her pipe and from what her mother said, ‘playing the whore’, lying and stealing. ”	258
7	1	228	1	“Mehitable Braybrook? 	22
7	1	228	2	Of Richard Braybrook’s? 	24
7	1	228	3	Was anyone with her?”	21
7	1	228	4	, Mary was all ears now.	24
7	1	229	1	“Yes.  	7
7	1	229	2	Yes.  	6
7	1	229	3	Yes. 	5
7	1	229	4	The only witness was a John Williston, a youth had related to me thus that as he was going to the meadows to make hay, Meddy had told him that my wife, or ‘her dame’ as she put it, was angry with her but that she would get even and so Meddy put a great toad in the milk kettle and told him about it the next morning with a countenance of wicked glee at her mischief saying “that should fix her!”.  	398
7	1	229	5	This being about July before the fire.  	40
7	1	229	6	She has from what I can tell,  been reckless before and shy of giving a fair report and playing the frail and fearful child for her own ends.”	142
7	1	230	1	“There is indeed a motive then for her to take revenge.”	56
7	1	231	1	“Our family was sickened by the soured and tainted milk.  	58
7	1	231	2	It caused the children nausea and delirium.  	45
7	1	231	3	Mary, I fear this girl could be in competition or opposition against your troop of just and benevolent wise ladies and gifted wives.”	133
7	1	232	1	“I know there’s someone out there, I just don’t know who or where yet but I’m tired of watching more pain and suffering.  	122
7	1	232	2	I feel like I have failed everyone and yet I’m so tired.”	57
7	1	233	1	“We have to work our minds, hearts and arms and not our arms alone.”	68
7	1	234	1	“Please do continue.  	22
7	1	234	2	So what happened to the home and the girl?  	44
7	1	234	3	Anyone hurt?”	13
7	1	235	1	“So she said that she was going outside and saw that the hogs had gone into the corn.  	87
7	1	235	2	She couldn’t see where all of them were so she said she climbed the oven on the back of the house to get a better view.  	121
7	1	235	3	As she neared the top, she used the roof thatch to steady herself but as she mounted the top with her other hand, she knocked the pipe out accidentally and she, thinking there was no fire in the pipe thought no more of it and went down to drive away the hogs out of the corn.  	277
7	1	235	4	As she went about driving the hogs out, and neared unto the rails of Abraham’s field which John Jr had granted him several years ago being newlywed, she looked back and saw the smoke rising right where she had dropped her pipe and panicked and went into Abraham Perkins, our nephew’s home and there found his wife Hannah, mentioning the kettle of clothes I had asked her help with.  	383
7	1	235	5	Hannah asked Meddy to go to the barn to summon her maid to watch her child as she went over to extinguish the fire.  	117
7	1	235	6	It seemed an oddly round about way to show her the fire.  	58
7	1	235	7	As they went back home, they saw the smoke now billowing.  	59
7	1	235	8	Hannah desperately tried to reach for the pail and fill it at the well but it was already part burned to the ground by the time she  got back.  	144
7	1	235	9	The thatch went ablaze and having no ladders or anyone else to call on and not able to withstand going nigh to it, the house burned to the ground.  	148
7	1	235	10	When she demanded her to tell her why she didn’t tell her about it immediately, Meddy said she was loath to frighten here and when asked why she did not run to put out the fire with a pail herself when it was small and she could climb to it, she said she was so panicked that she didn’t dare go to it.  	303
7	1	235	11	She said when she first saw her open the door, she asked Hannah why the woods looked so blue beyond our house since the smoke was there.  	138
7	1	235	12	Meddy added later that an hour before the fire, she was boiling a kettle of clothes and saw a chimney fire which frightened her but that she put that out with the lye water in the kettle.”	188
7	1	236	1	“What about Hannah’s testimony then?”	37
7	1	237	1	“She agreed in Meddy’s story that they saw the smoke and were unable to quench the fire in time and had to cease their efforts.”	128
7	1	238	1	“Was she found guilty?”	23
7	1	239	1	“Meddy showed up in court and was convicted of Extreme Carelessness If Not Willingly Setting the Fire due to John Williston’s forthcomingness and honesty.  	156
7	1	239	2	So Meddy went to jail and was whipped and has been ordered to repay me. 	72
7	1	239	3	I don’t know how a girl of her standing and illegitimacy would fare in working off that debt but I do not wish to employ her any more for what she did.  	153
7	1	239	4	I’ve forgiven her in my heart and am at peace in this matter.”	62
7	1	240	1	“Your of a stronger character than I am Jakey.  	48
7	1	240	2	At least it is not the plague.  	32
7	1	240	3	I’d rather lose my home than die that painful death.”	53
7	1	241	1	“We did well to leave the old kingdom.  	40
7	1	241	2	London is now a constant report of plague and death.  	54
7	1	241	3	We can take the pox when our strength is high and thus never be affected by it again.  	87
7	1	241	4	I don’t trust getting near the plague.”	39
7	1	242	1	“So Jake, do you need a place to stay?”	39
7	1	243	1	“Just the night for myself, my dear wife Elizabeth and the children, would they be trouble to stay a short season until I can rebuild?”	135
7	1	244	1	“I would not think of making you go back.  	43
7	1	244	2	You have a good inheritance that can help with the restoration.  	65
7	1	244	3	Do not be reluctant to make good use of what blessings you still have and can be thankful for.  	96
7	1	244	4	We will be close in here but your children are well behaved, they will help me where I have been wanting for help.  	116
7	1	244	5	Just come back and visit week to week for dinner at least will you?  	69
7	1	244	6	Do not leave your dear wife alone too long.”	44
7	1	245	1	Mary was no stranger to death by now but it was only next spring when another son of hers would be taken.  	107
7	1	245	2	Wymond had just had his son and decided he would sail off to make his living and trade in the Caribbean seas.  	111
7	1	245	3	He had escaped to a tiny volcanic island in the long chain of islands now overrun with pirates from Spain.  	108
7	1	245	4	Sarah was devastated.  	23
7	1	245	5	Major Pike and Captain Bradbury gave her comfort and assurances for the care of her two daughters and her one month old baby who she named for her husband.  	157
7	1	245	6	Wymond Jr, not knowing was a cheerful baby despite his mother’s forlorn and depressed state.  	94
7	1	245	7	Mary took her in and they became the best of friends and was like her own daughter.   	86
7	1	245	8	Her son Thomas, a successful businessman in Salisbury, taught at a grammar school and helped her husband run the grocery store, was doing extremely well as a weaver on the side with a business partner.  	203
7	1	245	9	Mary saw baby Wymond and for a moment, she thought he winked at her.  	70
7	1	245	10	Mary’s eyes grew wide wondering what this might mean but it wasn’t long before she would know.  	96
7	1	245	11	The baby who lost his father at birth was a special case indeed.  	66
7	1	245	12	Not only that but he was presented hips first and yet completely healthy. 	74
7	1	245	13	His large eyes stared everywhere in curiosity turning his head at almost all times to take the world in.  	106
7	1	245	14	Even with such blessing in store, Mary took to reading by candlelight after everyone slept drinking a tea to calm her nerves, exhausted with the burden of surviving so many unfortunate ones around her.  	203
7	1	245	15	She took to deep meditation and petitioning for protection from her enemies.	76
8	1	1	1	Before long, Mary’s children were dating and courting and getting married.	74
8	1	2	1	George Carr’s fortunes were threatened as demand for passage across his river grew and his customers grew.  	108
8	1	2	2	His only hope was to find a sympathetic ear in Newbury and Salisbury.  	71
8	1	2	3	Since Captain Bradbury had mercifully granted him a building contract for the floating bridge so many years ago in that first court order, it only made sense to persuade him again and if it meant forming an alliance between his sons and the Captain’s daughters all the better.  	278
8	1	2	4	It would have happened too except Mary had strictly put an end to it.  	71
8	1	2	5	Captain Bradbury listened to Mary’s intuition in all seriousness.  	67
8	1	2	6	Mary had told John Carr that he was too young to marry his daughter Jane and that she already had a favorite suitor by way of Henry True who was about her same age.  	166
8	1	2	7	It was a fair alternate reason to give instead of having to explain to the poor lad the business between her and her father and the decree of her mother that she both never forgot and kept to herself.  	202
8	1	2	8	She also saw through him George’s prodding to get in good with them again, ever the charmer.  	94
8	1	2	9	His business would certainly not help her family working hard down in Ipswich.  	80
8	1	2	10	This wouldn’t be the last run in she would have with the Carr boys.	67
8	1	3	1	Rebecca Wheelwright, daughter of John Wheelwright and sister in law to Anne Hutchinson, the midwife to Mary Dyer, had lost her husband Samuel Maverick in a mysterious incident earlier that year.  	196
8	1	3	2	She had just returned from Boston to go back home to her father in Salisbury and was new to town there.  	105
8	1	3	3	Rebecca was a very young widow and fair woman to look upon so she had many suitors from miles around.	101
8	1	4	1	One of them was James Carr, a year younger than William and very handsome but also very controlling.  	102
8	1	4	2	James doted on her with many gifts, clothes, sweets, and flowers.  	67
8	1	4	3	Rebecca, in her emotional confusion had double-booked her suitors.	66
8	1	5	1	William knocked on the young widow Maverick’s door.	51
8	1	6	1	“Oh my stars, I’ve done it again.”, mumbled Rebecca. 	53
8	1	6	2	“COME IN!  	11
8	1	6	3	William!”	9
8	1	7	1	“Who is this my dear?”	22
8	1	7	2	, asked James.	14
8	1	8	1	“James, this is my dear friend William Bradbury who donated flowers for my late husband’s funeral.  	100
8	1	8	2	Goodman William, this is the esteemed river baron, James Carr.”	63
8	1	9	1	“A good morrow James. 	22
8	1	9	2	How do you fare today?”	23
8	1	9	3	, William greeted him with gritting teeth.	42
8	1	10	1	No answer came from James but a hard stare.	43
8	1	11	1	“I beg your pardon Mister Carr, may I speak candidly to Rebecca for a moment?” 	79
8	1	11	2	he spoke, sideways to James and then faced Rebecca, “I thought your wish today was for me to accompany you to town so you could find some saddles to fit you for your late husband’s  horses.”	190
8	1	12	1	“It is but…..”, she blushed seeing his jaw drop a bit, “Oh, I’m so sorry William, with my mind so distraught and encumbered with the affairs of my late’s passing, I have had much frenzy of mind in properly inviting and keeping my own dates appointed in good order.”	265
8	1	13	1	“I am sorry too dear Rebecca.”, replied William starting to get annoyed with her but at the same time trying to be sympathetic to her pains.	140
8	1	14	1	“Just a moment William, what your family name might be, I was here by her request and she is in need of my care as I arrived afore you.”, snarled James.	152
8	1	15	1	“I have not spent little time in travelling here Good Sir.  	60
8	1	15	2	I am sorely put out with my travels here being in vain.  	57
8	1	15	3	Should I just return now?” 	27
8	1	15	4	said William in some huff.	26
8	1	16	1	“No William, stay.” pleaded Rebecca.	36
8	1	17	1	“I must not stay for your sake Rebecca but also for mine since I will not stay in the company of so rude a suitor.” he said to Rebecca and then turning to James, “I have seen men suit women for years with all my elder sisters and none of them have had your gall Good Sir.”, turning back to Rebecca again William turned to exit with the pains of rejection in his voice: “Good day Madam.”	386
8	1	18	1	Outside, William did not immediately leave but walked up and down and paced.	76
8	1	19	1	Inside, James quarreled with Rebecca, “Why did you invite him? 	63
8	1	19	2	Who do you fancy more Rebecca dear, me or him?” 	48
8	1	19	3	said an angry James.	20
8	1	20	1	“James, I told you, I forgot he was taking me to get a saddle and riding boots when you were coming over.” she pleaded.	119
8	1	21	1	William rode his horse back home, teary-eyed but not giving up.  	65
8	1	21	2	William took a shortcut through the marsh lands and splattered his clothes with gritty black mud.  	99
8	1	21	3	He now felt sad and angry with no one.  	40
8	1	21	4	He was only mad at fate and God for what had happened despite not knowing the matter of the Carr family.  	106
8	1	21	5	Mary was loathe to bring up that part of her past.  	52
8	1	21	6	As he walked in the door and stomped into the main room, Mary thought to herself Oh Dear, I hope he wasn’t jilted. 	115
8	1	21	7	Mary had picked up the new terms the children these days were starting to use, it wasn’t something she had heard of growing up. 	128
8	1	21	8	She fancied herself a more modern woman than people gave her credit for and chuckled inwardly but then checked in with the present moment and realized she had a very sad son on her hands.	187
8	1	22	1	“What happened Will?”	21
8	1	23	1	“The beautiful widow, Miss Rebecca Wheelwright Maverick,  who I told you that I saw in town,  had a Mister Carr with her.”, he grumbled.	136
8	1	24	1	“Carr?”	7
8	1	24	2	, she replied almost quizzically with raised eyebrow, “full name dear, full name.”	82
8	1	25	1	“James Carr.”	13
8	1	26	1	Mary thought for a moment to herself again How can that be? 	60
8	1	26	2	“My, this is worse than I thought, but if fate be true, then this cannot stand.” 	81
8	1	26	3	Mary remembered her mother’s words long before.  	49
8	1	26	4	“You cannot be so easily chased off by one mistake in a girl’s mind. 	69
8	1	26	5	If it is just a test, go back and you will find her again.  	60
8	1	26	6	If it is not meant to be, you will not find her again.  	56
8	1	26	7	Patience.  	11
8	1	26	8	She is still going through a lot and will not choose so hastily.  	66
8	1	26	9	Write her and tell her how you feel.”	37
8	1	27	1	William wrote her a letter after weeks of thought and hesitation:	65
8	1	29	1	Dearest Miss Rebecca Maverick,	30
8	1	32	1	I am grateful to you for being forthcoming about your dilemma of having much help in your travails and yet having much need for your own peace of mind.  	153
8	1	32	2	I apologize that I left in such haste and uncheerfulness.  	59
8	1	32	3	I would that you write me back when you would see me again and have fully mourned your late husband if I cannot see you sooner.  	129
8	1	32	4	I must confess, I had more interest in becoming better acquainted with you than I did looking through leathers at a store.  	124
8	1	32	5	I couldn’t get our first exchange of greeting out of my mind.  	63
8	1	32	6	Do you believe in love at first sight?	38
8	1	34	1	That you would need my help was an honor of course.  	53
8	1	34	2	So even now, I pledge to be more patient in offering these hands to your aid as was my wish.  	94
8	1	34	3	It was only one unfortunate mishap that I arrived in the midst of your previous engagement and I would not count it or remember it anymore.  	141
8	1	34	4	I would cheerfully like to help you another time to pick out a saddle and boots if that is still your need.  	109
8	1	34	5	It was silly of me to be so petulant so I ask your forgiveness.  	65
8	1	34	6	This day has taught me much.  	30
8	1	34	7	I would be willing to bet you could teach me more.  	52
8	1	34	8	As I was coming home, my dear mother reminded me of the great wisdom in Patience and when I look back upon it now, I can only laugh at my error and can only feel  joy that I at least got to see you once again and in good company and cheer.  	241
8	1	34	9	Please give Mr. 	16
8	1	34	10	Carr my apologies for my interruption.  	40
8	1	34	11	If you would like me to call on you, it would give me some joy to take you through the orchards I have planted here in Salisbury.  	131
8	1	34	12	Their paths are full of blossoms that remind me of the beauty of Mother Nature but even more my feelings for you.  	115
8	1	34	13	I pray God preserves you and clears a path of happiness, hope and joy for you which you so deserve regardless of anything else.	127
8	1	36	1	Yours in faith, hope and charity,	33
8	1	38	1	William Bradbury	16
8	1	40	1	William sent it the following day in Salisbury through his father who went to town regularly for work of one kind or another.  	127
8	1	40	2	He would easily find her father the pastor there.	49
8	1	41	1	“Good day Pastor”	17
8	1	42	1	“Good day it is Captain Bradbury.”	34
8	1	43	1	“I have a letter from my son...”	32
8	1	44	1	“Oh?”	5
8	1	45	1	“For your daughter!”	20
8	1	45	2	, he looked at him.	19
8	1	46	1	John Wheelwright secretly read the letter William wrote. 	57
8	1	46	2	He felt a sudden empathy for him. 	34
8	1	46	3	Before he handed the letter to his daughter Rebecca, he prefaced it with a little speech on forgiveness and noting that Captain Bradbury was an influential and well-respected man of their town, he thought immediately this would be profitable. 	243
8	1	46	4	He didn’t have to persuade much though.  	41
8	1	46	5	Rebecca had seen her father do this before and she was most impatient this time.	80
8	1	47	1	“Now, it is a virtue to forgive as well as forget my dear daughter.  	69
8	1	47	2	This is what the Lord asks of us.”	34
8	1	48	1	“Hand it to me please father?  	31
8	1	48	2	No more. 	9
8	1	48	3	Please!”	8
8	1	49	1	Rebecca read the letter and not only did she forgive him but she swooned with his writing and romantic flair. 	110
8	1	49	2	Rebecca had been lonely these days.  	37
8	1	49	3	James Carr never did return.  	30
8	1	49	4	She had no idea where he had gone.  	36
8	1	49	5	She wrote in response.  	24
8	1	49	6	Her father was also a very eloquent man and even suggested to her how to word it.  	83
8	1	49	7	She impatiently kept it brief.	30
8	1	50	1	Dear Mister William Bradbury,	29
8	1	51	1	I have had much time here lately to grieve and think all the things you wrote of. 	82
8	1	51	2	Also with  thanks to my dear father, our local Pastor, I have been afforded much advice also to reflect upon as well as the matters you have disclosed to me. 	158
8	1	51	3	I invite you to come back at any good time you wish. 	53
8	1	51	4	I have more to say when I see you again which I hope you will afford me.  	74
8	1	51	5	May the Lord watch over you and bless you.	42
8	1	52	1	With all my heart,	18
8	1	53	1	Rebecca Maverick	16
8	1	55	1	William and Rebecca fell rapidly in love with each other as William wrote her poetry regularly.  	97
8	1	55	2	She forgot all about James Carr and it wasn’t before long,	58
8	1	56	1	Mary was picking flowers for their wedding.  	45
8	1	56	2	She was picking a lot of flowers lately and taking them to the church to the point she started having the reputation of being “The Flower Lady”.  	146
8	1	56	3	If it wasn’t a wedding it was a funeral and if not a funeral, a wedding.  	74
8	1	56	4	All the time in between she was running her day care and Dame School and her home just about became a hotel of sorts with her friends, help and daughters taking care of all her guests.  	186
8	1	56	5	To feed  her guests, she often let them trade in livestock.  	61
8	1	56	6	Hogs, sheep and cows in particular.  	37
8	1	56	7	She also had enough cows to employ a team of milk maids and amongst themselves, they would make butter for the whole town as well as the specialty salves which she specialized in.  	181
8	1	56	8	They were usually kind enough to pay but on the rare occasion she reminded them and they didn’t, she would forgive their indebtedness in exchange for secrecy of that forgiveness so it would not invite further burden.	216
8	1	57	1	James Carr sat up in his bed in a sweat, feeling dread and fear of wild beasts all around him.  	96
8	1	57	2	After the day broke, he rode his yearling to Doctor Crosby’s.	61
8	1	58	1	“Good morrow Mr. 	17
8	1	58	2	Carr.  	7
8	1	58	3	What is it you seek my assistance for today?”	45
8	1	59	1	“I have been awake, fearing wild beasts have entered my room, trying to take me in my sleep.”	93
8	1	60	1	“For how long?”	15
8	1	61	1	“All last week and up until this day.”	38
8	1	62	1	“James, I think it’s nerves.  	30
8	1	62	2	Let me have a look at you.”	27
8	1	63	1	Doctor Crosby did his usual inspection for signs of bad humors and started looking through his book for herbs and medicines that would cure it.	143
8	1	64	1	“I have an elixir for you.  	28
8	1	64	2	It has some tobacco, brandy and a tiny bit of Jimson weed.  	60
8	1	64	3	Take this in the evening before you sleep.”	43
8	1	65	1	James went home and took this medicine religiously for ten months or so.  	74
8	1	65	2	It didn’t work and in fact continued.  	39
8	1	65	3	He went back time after time to Doctor Crosby who increased the dosage. 	72
8	1	65	4	It still didn’t work.	21
8	1	66	1	“Doctor Crosby, I don’t know why this isn’t working. 	53
8	1	66	2	I have been taking it as you instructed me to.”	47
8	1	67	1	“Mister Carr, I have a suspicion that this is not a physical ailment at all.”	77
8	1	68	1	“Oh?  	6
8	1	68	2	What is it then?”	17
8	1	69	1	“I suspect you have been behagged.  	36
8	1	69	2	You wouldn’t know anyone who you’ve seen lately that could do this do you?”	75
8	1	70	1	“I have also thought so a good while.”	38
8	1	71	1	“So who do you think may have behagged you?”	44
8	1	72	1	“I durst not say who because she is counted by all an honest woman.”	68
8	1	73	1	“Mr. 	5
8	1	73	2	Carr, if you don’t say, your condition will never change.”	58
8	1	74	1	“Goodwife Bradbury.”	20
8	1	75	1	“Mary Bradbury, wife of Captain Bradbury?”	42
8	1	76	1	“The same you have said.”	25
8	1	77	1	“This shouldn’t be said to anyone else Mr. 	43
8	1	77	2	Carr, but I do believe she has signed the Devil’s book and is a great deal worse than even Goody Martin.”	105
8	1	78	1	“You know I believe it’s true.  	32
8	1	78	2	There is a strange twist in all her workings so that whatever she looks sternly upon, it comes to perish sooner or later out of her sight.”	139
8	1	79	1	James went home and continued to take the physic which initially made him feel comfortable but after so much time, his eyes popped open and the fear of the dark came upon him.  	177
8	1	79	2	He went back to Doctor Crosby to tell him that it wasn’t working again.	71
8	1	80	1	“Doctor Crosby, I am still having the night fear and feelings of being ripped at by an invisible creature.  	108
8	1	80	2	I woke up again and I thought there was a cat by my bed.  	58
8	1	80	3	I tried to strike it off the bed but it was too fast and as my feet fell asleep and I was frightened, but I eventually got up and heard it coming back so I looked to see where it was if it came near me so I could strike it again. 	230
8	1	80	4	It got on the bed and I hit it and it was right after that I felt the medicine go to work and I was asleep again.  	115
8	1	80	5	I’m sure it’s Mary afflicting me in her spectral form.”	55
8	1	81	1	“That would explain why the physic suddenly worked.  	53
8	1	81	2	It must be witchcraft then!”	28
8	1	82	1	Mary was cautious of this arrangement between her son and Rebecca but she felt that for some unknown reason in the future, she had best go along with it.  	155
8	1	82	2	For one, her daughter in law’s father, Robert Pike was often displeased with the service Pastor Wheelwright gave, feeling it was hypocritically tolerant of the antinomians but intolerant of the Quakers.  	204
8	1	82	3	Major Pike was one of the most fair minded gentlemen she knew and while Pastor Wheelwright was very logical, he was also very opinionated and sometimes unfairly so.  	166
8	1	82	4	She did however sense in her heart that he could be persuaded with enough care and that things would work out in the end for him and that he would die of old age. 	163
8	1	82	5	Unfortunately, it was only a year later that her elder sister Elizabeth in the neighboring town of Amesbury passed away.   	123
8	1	82	6	Mary could tell it was coming but felt constrained to warn anyone of their oncoming death feeling it was one of the secrets she would take to her own grave.  	158
8	1	82	7	She remembered the advice and could never tell her own fate and she thought it just as well.	92
8	1	83	1	Salisbury, Massachusetts ,1678 - 1679	37
8	1	84	1	It was a late September at George Carr’s home.  	48
8	1	84	2	Doctor Crosby, the man who gave physic for James had just been seated.  	72
8	1	84	3	George sat at the head of the table with his sons on his right and his daughters on the left.  	95
8	1	84	4	George’s daughter Ann sat at the end next to her newly-wed husband Thomas Putnam Jr..  	87
8	1	84	5	Another guest, Dr. 	19
8	1	84	6	Zerubbabel Endecott, a man in his forties took up the other end of the table next to Dr. 	89
8	1	84	7	Crosby, Doctor Griggs and Timothy Swan on a side and his sons and daughters on the other.	89
8	1	85	1	Dr. 	4
8	1	85	2	Endicott spoke, “What I tell you here you must be kept with all confidence.  	77
8	1	85	3	The leaders of the people of Salisbury have fallen into deep transgression.  	77
8	1	85	4	The likes of Major Pike and Captain Bradbury release prisoners defying us and giving comfort to our sworn enemies the Quakers.  	128
8	1	85	5	The notorious Reverend Wheelwright also survives among them.  	62
8	1	85	6	The also surround themselves with sagamores and are becoming more difficult to deal with.  	91
8	1	85	7	I have heard Doctor Crosby’s account and it is clear that one of their women, Mary, is at the head of it all, taking away our business by practicing physic there.  	164
8	1	85	8	They refuse to come to us now.  	32
8	1	85	9	Not only this, they torment our patients with horrific spectres and curse our physic so that it can no longer avail itself according to its natural effect.”	156
8	1	86	1	“I have had no success in appealing to them for traffic, trade or relief of any kind.  	87
8	1	86	2	She has a long grudge against me and is a crazed woman with many subtle and treacherous ways full of trickery which they’ve learned from those who were at Merry Mount.  	169
8	1	86	3	Fortunately, we have extirpated many of their ilk.” spoke George in his persuasive and charming voice looking directly at Dr. 	126
8	1	86	4	Endicott, hoping he’d remember how his father dealt with Thomas Morton and hoping to create a guilt by association therewith.	125
8	1	87	1	Tom Putnam spoke next, “I say you should go up there to see them, test her wiles and we’ll see if these rumors are true.  	122
8	1	87	2	Go together so there is no chance of mischief and for a witness against her.”  	79
8	1	87	3	His wife Ann patted him in approval.	36
8	1	88	1	George looked at Richard, “You and I will go and spare James and John further trouble.  	88
8	1	88	2	I feel enough time has past that there is good hopes of swaying them to our point of view.  	92
8	1	88	3	I trust I can find a means of warning her.  	44
8	1	88	4	A mother’s dearest prize is her children.  	43
8	1	88	5	I’m now convinced we must ultimately deal with Mary as soon as that opportunity becomes available, that is, when she is without the company of Mr. 	147
8	1	88	6	Bradbury or her sons.”	22
8	1	89	1	Mary was cleaning up the pig pens, milking the cows, and helping her grandson Wymond Jr., “Wommy” in picking cherries and quince off the trees .  	146
8	1	89	2	She went inside to churn the butter.  	38
8	1	89	3	The wind started blowing hard and the lightning was starting to strike with torrential downpours that waved in one after the other.  	133
8	1	89	4	Wymond Jr., only 9 years old came running in. 	46
8	1	89	5	“Grandma grandma! 	18
8	1	89	6	I saw a giant! 	15
8	1	89	7	He had red eyes and great teeth in the forest. 	47
8	1	89	8	And then it started to rain.”	29
8	1	90	1	“Hush Wommy, it’s nothing but the storm.”, she said comforting him and turning him over to Sarah his mother. 	109
8	1	90	2	As soon as Sarah replied, “Wymond, remember what I said about tall tales.”, Mary felt a lump in her throat like there was more to this.  	137
8	1	90	3	There was a loud banging on the door like a knock, some whispers and the sound of footsteps running away.	105
8	1	91	1	Mary went out and noticed paper was nailed to the door. 	56
8	1	91	2	Mary’s drew a loud gasp in shock. 	34
8	1	91	3	Her son’s widow, Sarah went up to her seeing her reaction.  	60
8	1	91	4	Her hand covered her mouth.  	29
8	1	91	5	There in a blackened blood was a drawing of a simple skull and crossbones and some crossed out initials all ending with B.  	124
8	1	91	6	After staring at it, pale with shock, Sarah asked Mary in quivering voice, “Wha what does it mean?”	99
8	1	92	1	“It means, they are coming after me.” remarked Mary pointing at the initials.  	79
8	1	92	2	Her initials M.B. were at the bottom with the biggest line drawn through it. 	77
8	1	92	3	The lines had a small cross on the end so that the cross-out resembled a dagger.  	82
8	1	92	4	There were initials for everyone she could think of in her family.	66
8	1	93	1	Captain Bradbury came home later that evening and saw it. 	58
8	1	93	2	He tore it off the door and put it away in a box to keep as evidence.	69
8	1	94	1	Three days later, there were bloody feathers strewn before the door.  	70
8	1	94	2	Mary went through all her things, reading and researching frantically. 	71
8	1	94	3	She cleaned the rooms and asperged the room and burnt herbs and dried saps from the trees in a dish.	100
8	1	95	1	A couple months later just before the big harvest feast, Captain Thomas rode in on horseback, quickly dismounted and swung open the door and slammed it again and stood there out of breath.	188
8	1	96	1	“Our son.. 	11
8	1	96	2	John...was found dead in his new home.”	39
8	1	97	1	Mary’s eyes well up with tears, her face quivering trying to hold back full sobs.  	83
8	1	97	2	She sat motionless and stared.  	32
8	1	97	3	Her eyes, bagged with sadness overflowed streams of her tears over her now wrinkled but soft cheeks.   	103
8	1	97	4	She grabbed her husband’s arm.  	32
8	1	97	5	He comforted her and while there was a smallpox outbreak being rumored, John’s body had shown no signs as they went to him and gave him his burial together.  	158
8	1	97	6	William and Rebecca both showed up, her father Reverend Wheelwright gave the eulogy.  	86
8	1	97	7	William mourned loudly for his brother. 	40
8	1	97	8	Now both his younger brothers were gone.  	42
8	1	97	9	Rebecca and John Wheelwright tried to comfort him.	50
8	1	98	1	Mary was still wearing her black dress and neckcloth day to day with a black veil when she got another notice.  	112
8	1	98	2	It was the same paper, more blood and William’s name was crossed out with two daggers.	86
8	1	99	1	The grass was frosty still on the December morning when Reverend Wheelwright returned with the dire news only a little over a week later, “William has died.”  	159
8	1	99	2	Rebecca was not with him.  	27
8	1	99	3	She was rumored to have caught illness and was sick in bed, her lungs were wheezing and she was running a fever.  	114
8	1	99	4	She died only a few weeks later just before Christmas.  	56
8	1	99	5	Mary offered to care for the five children left behind.  	57
8	1	99	6	Reverend Wheelwright mentioned to her, “Mary, if there’s anything I could ever do to repay your kindness, it is done.”  	120
8	1	99	7	Mary nodded from within her quiet sobs.	39
8	1	100	1	With Rebecca’s death came a blizzard so that the entire coast was deeply blanketed in snow.  	93
8	1	100	2	Mary walked out in it’s powdery and glistening freshness in the light of the sun and breathed a long sigh.  	108
8	1	100	3	The vision of the clean white banks before gave her a feeling of loneliness and peace all at once.  	100
8	1	100	4	At night Mary went to her books and thumbed through the well worn book Cicero and The New Atlantis, Hamlet, The Holy Bible, Discoverie of Witchcraft, Ars Magna, De Heptarchia Mystica, and a book with alchemical symbols and Latin inscriptions and some books on science, medicine, herbs and her own writings.  	308
8	1	100	5	As she rummaged through her chest, she saw something she hadn’t seen in years.  	80
8	1	100	6	It was the small stained box with checker patterns on it with the family crest on it.  	87
8	1	100	7	There was a small slip of paper.  	34
8	1	100	8	Water had smeared most of the ink away.  	41
8	1	100	9	Mary could  barely make out the last words:	43
8	1	102	1	...family….will prevail.	24
8	1	103	1	And when the queen is checked by knights a-pair	47
8	1	104	1	Then case will breach and rook will capture there.	50
8	1	106	1	She carried it with her in a pocket she had sewn inside her coat.  	67
8	1	106	2	It seemed to rattle ever so softly.	35
8	1	107	1	It was early April and the leaves and blossoms were filling the orchards again.  	81
8	1	107	2	She thought how soon, there would be plenty of fruit to make pies with.  	73
8	1	107	3	She looked out across her farm looking for her sheep, pigs, cows, horses and chickens. 	87
8	1	107	4	There were so few.  	20
8	1	107	5	Most of them had gone to her children’s homes.  	48
8	1	107	6	Tom had been busy at the meeting house that Sabbath.  	54
8	1	107	7	As the sun reached the top of the sky marking the noon, Mary felt a buzzing feeling like a fly landing on her nose.  	117
8	1	107	8	A cloud of dust and the clopping of trotting horses broke through the edge of the clearing. 	92
8	1	107	9	The road bent around the treeline and was now bearing a familiar face. 	71
8	1	107	10	George Carr is back to try and force my hand to be lenient to him. 	67
8	1	107	11	Mary thought to herself and then realized how alone she was there at home.  	76
8	1	107	12	They were wearing their swords and wore the dress of their city’s militia and helms of metal.	93
8	1	108	1	“Mary!”	7
8	1	108	2	, shouted George followed by Richard and  couple other riders following behind.	79
8	1	109	1	She felt danger in that overly cordial voice.  	47
8	1	109	2	She went to the gate and quickly went inside.  	47
8	1	109	3	She heard their horses pick up to a gallop.  	45
8	1	109	4	Her heartbeat was pounding fast with the sound of the galloping.  	66
8	1	109	5	Her head felt a rush and her ears muffled themselves in the pressure.  	71
8	1	109	6	She put her hands in her pocket and held the box tightly.  	59
8	1	109	7	The lid seemed to loosen.  	27
8	1	109	8	She heard the sound of him laughing.	36
8	1	110	1	“Hahaha, oh, Mary my dear, don’t be in such a rush!  	53
8	1	110	2	The reputation of your hospitality is second to none, you wouldn’t want to lose that now would you?”	100
8	1	110	3	, said George followed by Richard’s laughter. 	46
8	1	110	4	“Please come out and have a couple words with me please?” 	58
8	1	110	5	he called over still out of sight.	34
8	1	111	1	Mary took the box out of her pocket. 	37
8	1	111	2	To her surprise, the lid flipped open on its own having been sealed for years. 	79
8	1	111	3	A long whispering wind sound came out of it.  	46
8	1	111	4	It otherwise looked empty.  	28
8	1	111	5	She closed it and saw the coat of arms of Francis Bacon with its red shield and boar cresting it.  	99
8	1	111	6	She saw in her mind the boar charging. 	39
8	1	111	7	Under her breath she frantically petitioned her ancestors and angels to banish this danger. 	92
8	1	111	8	Her mind went suddenly dark and she felt like she was sliding out of her body. 	79
8	1	111	9	She opened her eyes to a blue light and a prickling sensation crawled over her.	79
8	1	112	1	George’s horse neighed loudly and a loud thud heard as the horse hit the dusty ground.  	88
8	1	112	2	There was a loud commotion.	27
8	1	113	1	“Father! 	9
8	1	113	2	Father!”	8
8	1	114	1	“George!”	9
8	1	115	1	“Are you hurt!?”	16
8	1	116	1	“What was that!”	16
8	1	117	1	“Did you see that?”	19
8	1	118	1	“What did you see?”	19
8	1	119	1	“It was blue. 	14
8	1	119	2	Fast. 	6
8	1	119	3	A boar, hairy fat and with ermine.”	35
8	1	120	1	“Did you see the tusks on that thing?”	38
8	1	121	1	“It was huge!”	14
8	1	122	1	“Change of plans.”	18
8	1	123	1	“Move!”	7
8	1	124	1	“She’s placed a guardian”	25
8	1	125	1	“It’s her phantom.”	19
8	1	126	1	“She changed into the boar and charged you father.”	51
8	1	127	1	“It’s her witchcraft.  	23
8	1	127	2	I told you she was dangerous.”	30
8	1	128	1	“I’ll bring complaints against her to the court if that’s what it takes.”	73
8	1	129	1	“We saw it father.  	20
8	1	129	2	We’ll go with you.”	19
8	1	130	1	“The scheming sorceress, she shall pay for her dark arts against us.”	69
8	1	131	1	Mary was safely away from them now.  	37
8	1	131	2	She was inside behind the latched door.  	41
8	1	131	3	She felt a dizziness.  	23
8	1	131	4	In her mind’s eye, she could see herself taken over by a rage that matched her fear and saw herself running into a horse at its forelegs and knocking it.   	156
8	1	131	5	Was it real? 	13
8	1	131	6	Protective magic? 	18
8	1	131	7	How could it be evil if it saved her.	37
8	1	132	1	In the weeks to come, the rumors would spread all over Ipswich that Mary was a witch.  	87
8	1	132	2	George told his family that Mary charged him, but not with her usual form. 	75
8	1	132	3	He claimed that as she went around a corner and about faced, in her place this blue boar came out and charged him, knocking him over. 	134
8	1	132	4	He claimed she had transformed into the boar. 	46
8	1	132	5	The same witch gossip all over again.  	39
8	1	132	6	Most the people had heard this before and laughed it off.  	59
8	1	132	7	But many of the doctors and others who held grudges or jealousies towards Mary took his account more seriously.	111
8	1	133	1	“Mary’s such a sweet lady, she couldn’t hurt a fly.”	52
8	1	134	1	“What do you mean a blue boar?”	31
8	1	135	1	“She’s always helping others and sacrificing to do so.  	56
8	1	135	2	There’s no charge that she is consorted with the Devil or signed the book.”	75
8	1	136	1	“Always such quarrels and rumors.  	35
8	1	136	2	Don’t speak unless you want to be suspected of being in league with that whole affair.”	87
8	1	137	1	“I don’t subscribe to that non-sense.”	38
8	1	138	1	Samuel Endicott came up with a story later after he came back from a voyage in the Caribbean that Mary had sold them bad butter and cursed their vessel.	152
8	1	139	1	Massachusetts, 1680-1692	24
8	1	140	1	Mary now had four surviving daughters, three married off: Judith, Mary and Jane. 	81
8	1	140	2	Elizabeth her youngest was a becoming a spinster like her namesake, unmarried at the late age of 30.  	102
8	1	140	3	The widow Sarah Pike and her three children were coming over and her new four orphans were staying with her, between three and eight years of age.  	148
8	1	140	4	Tom was working hard to support her efforts.  	46
8	1	140	5	She made some money churning butter and going into town to sell it and then picking up recruits.  	98
8	1	140	6	By then, it seemed the rumors were flying again and she even had people approaching her to teach them white magic and theurgy.  	128
8	1	140	7	They didn’t always have the best of intentions.	47
8	1	141	1	A woman named Goodwife Sibley came over to visit one day for which Mary had prepared a private consulting area.	111
8	1	142	1	“Goodwife Bradbury, my husband John, I feel like he’s being taken away from me by another and she appeareth to me to work evil and has familiarity with the Devil.  	164
8	1	142	2	I need a spell to detect the witch.  	37
8	1	142	3	I want to destroy her and claim him back.”	42
8	1	143	1	“I don’t know any spells I trust on that. 	42
8	1	143	2	I can’t perform any for you.  	30
8	1	143	3	I can only tell you the things I know.”	39
8	1	144	1	“I don’t care how, I just want power.”	38
8	1	145	1	“Have you been a good friend to him, a listening ear, a help to him?  	70
8	1	145	2	You can also ask him to help you.  	35
8	1	145	3	A man loves who he serves good or bad after all.”	49
8	1	146	1	“I tried that already.  	24
8	1	146	2	Please tell me a spell.  	25
8	1	146	3	I know you can work them.  	27
8	1	146	4	How do you detect a witch?  	28
8	1	146	5	Do you know about witch cake?”	30
8	1	147	1	“Why do you want to know?”	26
8	1	148	1	“I must know if my husband is bewitched or not.”	48
8	1	149	1	“It’s simple enough.  	22
8	1	149	2	Take his waters and mix with rye meal and bake it.  	52
8	1	149	3	Then feed it to your dog.  	27
8	1	149	4	If the dog rolls around on the ground, or has fouled temper, then it may be that someone has tampered with your husband, otherwise, the dog will favor the scent of his master and his mate. 	189
8	1	149	5	Tell it to no one.  	20
8	1	149	6	It is meant for the master and his dog only.  	46
8	1	149	7	The next time the malevolent witch,  is present, he will do the same as if he ate the cake. 	92
8	1	149	8	If it only be a witch doctor or physic true for ailment, then the dog will avoid the cake.  	92
8	1	149	9	The good doctor knows that the antidote is bitter to take, the mischievous doctor will sweeten his poison for his victim.  	123
8	1	149	10	Be wise and not carefree in doing this and it will surely work.  	65
8	1	149	11	Never feed it to a human or take it yourself or you will endanger them.”	72
8	1	150	1	“Thank you Mrs. 	16
8	1	150	2	Bradbury.”	10
8	1	151	1	Mary suddenly felt a side stitch of pain.  	43
8	1	151	2	It was a familiar pain that meant there was something amiss in the virtue of her teaching.  	92
8	1	151	3	This Goodwife Sibley had more power she wanted to use and was not fully honest and trying her.  	96
8	1	151	4	Something about her namesake niece would vex her over this and something she might do to misuse it would cause trouble, she thought to warn her fairly but it was meant for her to know in the great scheme of things.	214
8	1	152	1	Every week would pass and Mary Bradbury would see Mary Sibley there hoping to learn from her.  	95
8	1	152	2	“Do you know a love potion?  	29
8	1	152	3	Can you show me how to turn into a beast?  	43
8	1	152	4	I’m working on a spell but I need magic.  	42
8	1	152	5	I need power.  	15
8	1	152	6	Can I get it from the demons or something else? 	48
8	1	152	7	I want something very powerful.  	33
8	1	152	8	I rather have demons than angels. ”	35
8	1	153	1	Mary grew tired of replying that she didn’t follow those paths.  	65
8	1	153	2	Mary Sibley was obsessed with power to the point, Mary avoided her but she showed up to class.  	96
8	1	153	3	One day during class, Mary took out one of her homemade books full of translations and read all of them a story.  	114
8	1	153	4	Mary Warren was with Mary Sibley along with her children and other children in her family.  	92
8	1	153	5	Mary read in her usual slow voice adding pauses to keep them listening in suspense as she was used to:	102
8	1	154	1	The Witch, the Glass and the Wayward Pupil	42
8	1	155	1	A witch was approached one bright and sunny day by a young pupil who had sought her out because of her reputation for great power. 	131
8	1	155	2	But when he saw her, he was extremely disappointed because she was fumbling around slowly and seemingly haphazardly through old papers with a big old eccentric looking glass. 	175
8	1	155	3	He thought to himself, "My word, she can barely see! 	53
8	1	155	4	It must be I am too late and she is already past her time. 	59
8	1	155	5	How can this old fool be a powerful witch? 	43
8	1	155	6	I've come this far, I will show her and test her with a demanding question. 	76
8	1	155	7	If she be worthy of me, I will then obtain more learning and power from her."	77
8	1	156	1	After a cordial introduction, he finally asked, "What can I do to obtain great power? 	86
8	1	156	2	I do not care the consequences, I do not care to study. 	56
8	1	156	3	I just want something that will work. 	38
8	1	156	4	I know you can do this because you have studied long and are renowned for your greatness. 	90
8	1	156	5	Please teach me something quickly and I will bother you no more."	65
8	1	157	1	To which the wise madam replied:	32
8	1	158	1	"One can more easily understand power by understanding those things that are a simulacrum of it. 	97
8	1	158	2	Take for example this looking glass. 	37
8	1	158	3	(The pupil was already rolling his eyes just out of her view.) 	63
8	1	158	4	You could say that it has power by virtues of its clarity and smoothly curved form but it's only by moving it the proper distance, positioning it and focusing it that you are able to realize it. 	195
8	1	158	5	Not only that, you must have patience before anything will burn under its brightness. 	86
8	1	158	6	Those who fail to understand the power of the glass often try to use it forcefully. 	84
8	1	158	7	They push the glass against their objective with undesirable results. 	70
8	1	158	8	In frustration some even smash it thinking it would not work without greater force. 	84
8	1	158	9	The end result of their effort is usually broken glass and no power. 	69
8	1	158	10	I have done as you requested, you may bother me no more."	57
8	1	159	1	"Is that it?!" 	15
8	1	159	2	thought the pupil, feeling very nonplussed and scowling in contempt. 	69
8	1	159	3	But before he could open his mouth to complain he felt a rather sudden and piercing burning sensation on his foot. 	115
8	1	159	4	Upon jumping up and down and shouldering his bags, he left in great haste and confusion. 	89
8	1	159	5	In his flight away from the witch the pupil was finally enlightened.  	70
8	1	159	6	The End.	8
8	1	161	1	After class, Mary stomped forward with a scowl on her face: “Trying to tell me something?”	90
8	1	162	1	“Goodwife Sibley , I can make butter for you.  	47
8	1	162	2	I can make salve.  	19
8	1	162	3	I know what people say but no, I will not teach you how to get power.  	71
8	1	162	4	You will bring a great curse upon yourself.  	45
8	1	162	5	Those who seek power are almost never worthy of it.  	53
8	1	162	6	Those who avoid power will doubtless attract it.  	50
8	1	162	7	Remember that and when you have lost all power and lust for power, then please do come back.”	93
8	1	163	1	Mrs Sibley left in a huff.  	28
8	1	163	2	“Well, if you will not help me.  	33
8	1	163	3	I will find someone else who will.  	36
8	1	163	4	You’re a fraud Mary.  	22
8	1	163	5	You have no power and I will prove it!  	40
8	1	163	6	Just try to stop me.”	21
8	1	164	1	Salem, Massachusetts, 1692	26
8	1	165	1	It was a cold February morning in Salem.  	42
8	1	165	2	Mary Sibley, grey and black hair covered in bonnet and wearing her neckcloth and and a black dress went to visit Samuel Parris who lived right by her to see for herself the problem of their bewitchment and to offer assistance by means of her craft of physic.	258
8	1	166	1	She saw soon enough for herself that the girls were in a delirium, screaming and clenching their fists.  	105
8	1	166	2	Mary saw Tituba, a slave of Reverend Parris tending to the girls when they came out of it.  	92
8	1	166	3	Some of the girls even shouted at Mary when she got close to her.  	67
8	1	166	4	They snarled like beasts.	25
8	1	167	1	“Goodwife Sibley , is there no physick I can give them?  	57
8	1	167	2	My Betty is only a child.  	27
8	1	167	3	There are only nine years she has passed.  	43
8	1	167	4	I trust you are familiar with the warding of witchcraft?”	57
8	1	167	5	, groaned Reverend Parris ending in whining.	44
8	1	168	1	“I am familiar with it Reverend, for it takes a knowledge of their Arts to defeat their Arts.  	95
8	1	168	2	Know for certain that I only use this knowledge to defeat them and not to practice against anyone.”, said Mrs Sibley .	118
8	1	169	1	“I cannot be seen associated with this, this abominable trade, even though you work it for good, I want no one’s eyes to see me with it as I am a holy man called of God to teach his flock..”	190
8	1	170	1	Mary was distraught that Reverend Parris would not let her work straight away.  	80
8	1	170	2	She saw Tituba’s husband, John Indian at the table that evening.  	66
8	1	170	3	On the way home, Mary found John Indian again but helping Tituba clean up.  	76
8	1	170	4	She went over intent on giving him the remedy since she could not do so herself or get near the girls.	102
8	1	171	1	“Mr. 	5
8	1	171	2	John Indian.”	13
8	1	172	1	“Goodwife Sibley, what matter do you have?”	43
8	1	173	1	“I saw your wife, Tituba helping the girls.  	45
8	1	173	2	She can get near them but I cannot, yet, I know something a friend told me long ago that could bring light to whether the girls be cursed or not.”	146
8	1	174	1	“What do you want from me?”	27
8	1	175	1	“I only wish to tell you that which can help the girls.  	57
8	1	175	2	Either you or your good wife could perform this and then let me know if it has any efficacy.  	94
8	1	175	3	Do you want to know it?”	24
8	1	176	1	“I want to know it if it will help these girls and my wife find favor in her master’s eyes.  	93
8	1	176	2	He is a stern man and stubborn as well.  	41
8	1	176	3	If you have something for that, I would trade you all my tobacco for it.” he said as he was smoking his long pipe.	114
8	1	177	1	“Here it is then, take rye meal and the waters of these girls and mix it well and bake it.  	92
8	1	177	2	Feed it to a dog.  	19
8	1	177	3	If the dog fusses, they are indeed bewitched.  	47
8	1	177	4	If the dog turns away, it is only the work of our Mother in nature and our Lord.  	82
8	1	177	5	If indeed the dog sees the witch again, it will make the same fuss as it did before.  	86
8	1	177	6	Did you take a full understanding of it John?”	46
8	1	178	1	“Yes Madam.”	12
8	1	179	1	The next day, Tituba collected the urine from Betty and her cousin Abigail to make the cakes and she explained it all to them as they were calm at the time.  	158
8	1	179	2	The baking of it made a great stench in the home much to the family’s disliking.  	82
8	1	179	3	It gave the girls another fit.  	32
8	1	179	4	John Indian fed it to their dog.  	34
8	1	179	5	Sure enough, the dog started to growl after eating the cake.  	62
8	1	179	6	The dog barked at Tituba and the girls together.  	50
8	1	179	7	This was enough for Reverend Parris who watched in awe.	55
8	1	180	1	At church, Reverend Parris gave his speech.  	45
8	1	180	2	“Do not suffer a witch to live.”.	33
8	1	181	1	Thomas Putnam went to Reverend Parris with his wife Ann and their daughter Ann.  	81
8	1	181	2	Ann was having the same fits.	29
8	1	182	1	“Why have you allowed this Reverend?  	38
8	1	182	2	Are you not a pastor? 	22
8	1	182	3	Is not a pastor a caretaker of the flock?”	42
8	1	183	1	Reverend Parris whimpered a bit and shrugged.	45
8	1	184	1	“My daughter Ann is now bewitched and so is the Hubbard girl.  	63
8	1	184	2	You have preached to us the truth.  	36
8	1	184	3	Do not suffer a witch to live!  	32
8	1	184	4	It is therewith your duty to find who has done this and not suffer them to live but take them to trial if you will not suffer it yourself.”	139
8	1	185	1	“Betty?  	9
8	1	185	2	Who did this to you?”	21
8	1	186	1	“It was Tituba, it is she who did it to me.”	44
8	1	187	1	Reverend Parris brought Tituba back in the room. 	49
8	1	187	2	He beat her with a long stick, caning her back, legs and face.  	64
8	1	187	3	Tituba thought her nose might have been broken but her cheekbone seemed to have cracked and the skin over it drew blood.  	122
8	1	187	4	Reverend Parris had brought them in from his beautiful plantation in Barbados.  	80
8	1	187	5	The embarrassment Reverend Parris seemed to continually draw was always taken out on her.	89
8	1	188	1	“Did not the dog bark at you?”	30
8	1	189	1	“He does that always to me Good Reverend. 	42
8	1	189	2	He barks at everyone who comes in the home.”	44
8	1	190	1	“But he is not barking now, it was for the cause of those cakes you made, was it not?”	86
8	1	191	1	“Yes, Good Reverend  I made it to detect the witch.”	52
8	1	192	1	“But it is by your folly and the betrayal of the Devil that he has not covered your deeds.  	92
8	1	192	2	It is written that the devil will forsake his own.  	52
8	1	192	3	Just confess it?  	18
8	1	192	4	Why did you bewitch my girls?  	31
8	1	192	5	If you were working white magic, they would not still be bewitched!”	68
8	1	193	1	“Master, I beg you, let me tell you, let the girls tell you who the witches are. 	81
8	1	193	2	They will tell you that I am not alone.  	41
8	1	193	3	Killing me will not end their curse nor allow me to tell you who did this to your daughters.  	94
8	1	193	4	I’m sorry!  	12
8	1	193	5	I’m sorry I bewitched them!”	28
8	1	194	1	Reverend Parris got the names of Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne and because of the advice of Thomas Putnam and company, they were arrested and jailed the next day.  	163
8	1	194	2	From this teapot, a tempest brewed and more of Ann’s friends went on to denouncing others.  	92
8	1	194	3	Mercy Lewis, Mary Walcott, Mary Warren, Elizabeth Hubbard joined.  	67
8	1	194	4	Ann felt a sudden surge of power.  	35
8	1	194	5	Her father and mother whispered in her ear and suggested names.  	65
8	1	194	6	During the month’s head, the news of Salem went far and wide.  	63
8	1	194	7	Martha Corey, old Rebecca Nurse, all friends and customers of Mary no longer showed up.  	89
8	1	194	8	Mary wept bitterly when she heard what Mary Walcott had done.  	63
8	1	194	9	Mary was Mary Sibley’s niece by marriage. 	42
8	1	194	10	She refused to talk to her from thenceforth and took to praying and petitioning for mercy on these ladies.  	108
8	1	194	11	Her family regularly prayed for them and there was a lot of discontent raised against the courts in Salem over it but these were ignored.  	139
8	1	194	12	John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin turned their ears deaf to them.	65
8	1	195	1	Over the course of the next week, more news arrived by way of Abraham Perkins.  	80
8	1	195	2	Samuel Brabrook was deputized as a Marshal in Salem.  	54
8	1	195	3	He had arrested a four year old girl, Dorothy Good, daughter of Sarah and William.	82
8	1	196	1	Mary knew who was behind it and that she had already been labeled a witch by them.  	84
8	1	196	2	She wondered if it would only be a matter of time when their attention would turn to her.  	91
8	1	196	3	Mary still snuck to the prison one day to give Sarah and Dorothy food.  	72
8	1	196	4	Sarah was pregnant.  	21
8	1	196	5	Each time she visited, she knew the deputies were reporting her visit.  	72
8	1	196	6	The next time she came, she was turned away and made to go back home with the food.  	85
8	1	196	7	The shadow of evil there was dense.  	37
8	1	196	8	She was blocked at every turn and frustrated.  	47
8	1	196	9	It was there her grandmother, Isabelle appeared and whispered to her mind in the evening.  	91
8	1	196	10	Mary, do not blame yourself.  	30
8	1	196	11	Continue to work but beware the evil there.  	45
8	1	196	12	Take courage, you will still have a hand in helping to save many.  	67
8	1	196	13	Do not revile against your enemies as they will use it against you.  	69
8	1	196	14	Set your example and influence around you.  	44
8	1	196	15	I will show you what you need to see when it is expedient for you.	66
8	1	197	1	Mary received word that George Burroughs, the former Salem minister and good man was arrested along with the Proctors.  	120
8	1	197	2	George tried to escape but they gave him chase and were able to spy and jail him back in Boston.  	98
8	1	197	3	By May, the word came out that the Governor Phips had stacked the courts to hear the cases.  	93
8	1	197	4	The Court of Oyer and Terminer was created and assigned, leaving out all rational and cool minds and putting in those hotheads, Hathorne and Corwin in charge of the whole thing. 	178
8	1	197	5	It was only a few days later, in early June that the sixty-year old widow of Thomas Oliver, Bridget Bishop was tried and convicted and sentenced to death, all in one day.	170
8	1	198	1	Only two days later, the tenth day of June, she was hung.  	59
8	1	198	2	Nathaniel Saltonstall, one of the resigned and Corwin took over his duties.  	77
8	1	198	3	While he was a hothead, he was also principled.  	49
8	1	198	4	Hathorne commented as he was leaving, “He sickened me.  	56
8	1	198	5	Too weak for the errand of the Lord.  	38
8	1	198	6	All the better that Jonathan Corwin take his place at my side.”	63
8	1	199	1	Thomas and Mary were saddened but not surprised.	48
8	1	200	1	“I knew this would happen.” said Mary woefully, “I knew Thomas and Bridget were quarrelsome as a couple but she was no witch! 	126
8	1	200	2	The only thing she did know was their business.”	48
8	1	201	1	“She was an easy target.  	26
8	1	201	2	Everyone saw her as a black widow and loud mouth.  	51
8	1	201	3	I had told her to keep her mouth shut in public but she and Mr. 	64
8	1	201	4	Oliver had to drag it all about in public.”	43
8	1	202	1	“Do you think the Carrs or Putnams were upset about the money Thomas Oliver left her or the fact she’d marry his brother and continue to gain from it?”	151
8	1	203	1	“I do in fact think that this is what it’s all about.  	55
8	1	203	2	She would now have little claim on anything that they now couldn’t take away.  	79
8	1	203	3	Her children would either marry hers or lose their inheritance.  	65
8	1	203	4	They’re shrewd enough a family to get away with trying to use the courts and witchcraft to take out their debtors, their competition and those who they think got away with their moneys.  	187
8	1	203	5	They’re greedy little sharks.  	31
8	1	203	6	I pray the Lord forgive me for what I now think.  	50
8	1	203	7	I should cease and keep silent and keep hope.  	47
8	1	203	8	I am far too likely to get embroiled in this given what I know about them.  	76
8	1	203	9	We’re safely far away from it for now, but I feel it’s only a matter of time before they come back to us.  	107
8	1	203	10	They know it will be harder so they’ll have to use everything we can.”	70
8	1	204	1	“I heard it was little Ann Putnam, you know, Ann Carr’s daughter?”	66
8	1	204	2	, replied Tom.	14
8	1	205	1	“She’s but a thirteen year old, older than the other girls.  	61
8	1	205	2	They’re working her alight.  	29
8	1	205	3	I wonder if George or Thomas are giving her names.”	51
8	1	206	1	“That reminds me, did you keep the hogs tied up today?”	55
8	1	206	2	, replied Tom.	14
8	1	207	1	“Those little pigs are smart and can escape just about anything.  	66
8	1	207	2	I did the best I could.”	24
8	1	208	1	July came around and news came about that Sarah Good had delivered and lost her daughter in prison, appropriately but hopelessly named Mercy.  	143
8	1	208	2	Mary’s eyes were starting to look like continual tear fountains.  	66
8	1	208	3	The only joy she took was in teaching and helping others avoid the fate of being accused by counseling them and helping them avoid detection.  	143
8	1	208	4	Countless people were accused of being witches in those days.   	64
8	1	208	5	But it seemed it mattered little if one was a witch or not anymore.  	69
8	1	208	6	If those girls received the whispers in their ears about you, you would be a witch regardless of what you could do or how old you were.  	137
8	1	208	7	If it seemed they could stoke your anger with ease, they would give it a full go.  	83
8	1	208	8	Only weeks later, on the nineteenth day of July Sarah Good and four others were hanging in Boston.  	100
8	1	208	9	All of them good people.	24
8	2	1	1	Samuel Endicott sat at a desk, flipping through the book of his father’s with the usual pretentious long title doctors then liked to use, Synopsis Medicinae or a Compendium of Galenical and Chymical Physick Showing  the Art of Healing according to the Precepts of Galen & Paracelsus Fitted universally to the whole Art of Healing . 	332
8	2	1	2	The book was full of dark potions full of animal dismemberments, folk magic and witchcraft itself. 	99
8	2	1	3	Timothy Swann sat across from him with a wide creased grin and dark eyes, looking youthful except for his wrinkled face.  	122
8	2	1	4	He smoked a pipe taking a puff frequently.  	44
8	2	1	5	He coughed viciously every five minutes.	40
8	2	2	1	“Ironic is it not?”	19
8	2	3	1	“What is?” 	11
8	2	3	2	he asked coughing up a lung right there at the sudden need to now speak.	72
8	2	4	1	“I have none of my father’s skill as a physick and yet I have and will accomplish everything he set out to do.  	112
8	2	4	2	Purge the land of miscreants.  	31
8	2	4	3	Do you think someday I could be like grandfather?” 	51
8	2	4	4	asked Samuel.	13
8	2	5	1	“The governor?  	16
8	2	5	2	Of course, it’s always a process of small moves, each one forward, removing the obstacles in the way.  	103
8	2	5	3	That obstacle is almost always a person who does not deserve to be there.” said Tim in his suave tone.  	104
8	2	5	4	Tim was tall, dark of hair, handsome and also completely sadistic.  	68
8	2	5	5	His chosen apparel was dark all through and appropriate for his demeanor.	73
8	2	6	1	“The current governor is a fool.  	34
8	2	6	2	No worries, he’ll be replaced soon.  	37
8	2	6	3	I have an errand for you having to do with the Bradburys.  	59
8	2	6	4	A court date has already been planned.” snarled Samuel.	55
8	2	7	1	“Captain Bradbury owes me.  	28
8	2	7	2	He broke my scythe.  	21
8	2	7	3	I don’t like the one he replaced it with.  	43
8	2	7	4	He says it’s just as sharp but it looks older and I don’t think it cuts as well as my old one.  	96
8	2	7	5	So do I have your word that Richard Carr will renew on the Merrimack River deal with me?”	89
8	2	7	6	, Tim asked innocently.	23
8	2	8	1	“You barely need my help, you can work the courts better than old George Carr could, but I will be talking with him soon about this.  	134
8	2	8	2	I’ll talk to him about the timber delivery you owe him.” answered Samuel.	73
8	2	9	1	“I don’t need the courts to settle everything.  	48
8	2	9	2	I’ll just have my boys go around and burn their barns.” bragged Tim.	68
8	2	10	1	“You’re also just like your father Tim.”	40
8	2	11	1	“He was a ruffian.  	20
8	2	11	2	I just added polish.  	22
8	2	11	3	Father once tore down and burned fences, beheaded a hundred chickens and plucked out 146 apple trees.  	103
8	2	11	4	I’m still trying to top that one.  	35
8	2	11	5	I did take some barking dogs and hang them last week.  	55
8	2	11	6	I have the worst neighbors imaginable. 	39
8	2	11	7	Luckily, the owners were away and left them alone.” and after all that he ran out of breath and coughed loudly into a handkerchief.	131
8	2	12	1	“Tim, you’re ill and it’s that bitch Mary’s fault.  	52
8	2	12	2	You have every right to hang her.  	35
8	2	12	3	All you have to do is sign some papers here and we’re set.” pleased Samuel.	75
8	2	13	1	Tim gave the papers a lookover and signed them, all of them going over how Mary Bradbury afflicted him and tormented him.	121
8	2	14	1	“Can you think of anything I can add Tim?  	43
8	2	14	2	Mary has no direct male heirs left. 	36
8	2	14	3	Five out of six sons of Captain Bradburys are dead and the last one is a sodomite who will die without posterity.” retorted Samuel.	131
8	2	15	1	Timothy read a few of them and laughed.  	41
8	2	15	2	“I have a few suggestions but I’ll save those for later. 	57
8	2	15	3	I worry our lame and useless Governor Phips might interrupt our progress in exterminating the vermin out of our midst.  	120
8	2	15	4	The spoils might not seem much.  	33
8	2	15	5	The church ministers will step in and debate it as they usually do.”	68
8	2	16	1	“I figure I’ll soon have to confront Mary face to face and she is not easy to deal with.  	90
8	2	16	2	Every work I try against her backfires.  	41
8	2	16	3	I will employ new dark efforts to seal this bargain with my master.”	68
8	3	1	1	The birds were chirping a little louder than usual outside.  	61
8	3	1	2	The perched over the new tender branches overlooking Mary Bradbury’s gardens. 	78
8	3	1	3	The garden walls looked covered with a giant green lace with their tall vines running along trellises that wove intricate patterns that  Thomas had put together.  	163
8	3	1	4	The peas had shot up early.  	29
8	3	1	5	The sun shone through dew drops which slowly receded away.  	60
8	3	1	6	Mary’s bones were aching but stood there envisioning the herb garden perennials coming back.  	94
8	3	1	7	The trees were showing new green on the ends of their branches, their spring flower petals creating a walkway around them.	122
8	3	2	1	Several thuds and a man’s voice was heard in the distance ever so faintly but nonetheless did not prevent the birds fluttering away.  	134
8	3	2	2	Springy branches rained their last dew on the grasses below. 	61
8	3	2	3	The yells of a coachman and squeaky coach could be heard now in the distance.  	79
8	3	2	4	She went inside feeling that the bad omens she had staved away were finally making their appearance.  	102
8	3	2	5	Her heart sunk and the feeling of a swarm of butterflies and a nest of rattlers filled her entire being.  	106
8	3	2	6	She sat there looking blankly.  	32
8	3	2	7	There was no time to run or escape or find a place.  	53
8	3	2	8	Tom sensed her nervousness and heard the sound.  	49
8	3	2	9	He strapped on his boots and walked out to the front court of his home watching and gritting his teeth as they neared.	118
8	3	3	1	Finally as the horses stopped a well dressed man in a frilly shirt and heavy coat stepped down from his seat and walked up to them, stirring dust with his heavy boots.  	169
8	3	3	2	Two younger men in sergeant uniforms accompanied him.  	55
8	3	3	3	The stepped down to hold the horse reins.  	43
8	3	3	4	His grey hair was pulled tightly back into a black ribbon typically seen of professional coachmen.  	100
8	3	3	5	His bony face and eye sockets betrayed a kind of wiry strength of the well-worked under his vestments.	102
8	3	4	1	“Constable Neale, what are you doing here at my home this fine day?” 	69
8	3	4	2	asked Tom, his hair still unruly from the last night’s slumber.	63
8	3	5	1	The constable’s stolid voice and face bespake the gravity of his message:  “By the authority of the Court of Essex for our Sovereign Lord and Lady, the King and Queen, I am ordered to take Mary Bradbury to Ipswich gaol to await further examination and questioning. 	265
8	3	5	2	Will she come peaceably and without resistance Captain?”	56
8	3	6	1	Mary crestfallen from the morning’s usual springtime gaiety answered, “I shall go Tom.”	87
8	3	7	1	Tom looked around in desperation, jaw dropped to the ground in disbelief.  	75
8	3	7	2	Two men stepped forward with Tom clenching his fists but unable to move. 	73
8	3	7	3	Anger flushed through his face and adrenaline started to shake him as if he had just finished a bout of fisticuffs.	115
8	3	8	1	They bound her hands in rope and she stumbled and began to complain of the tightness and begged, “I plead with you gentlemen, I say, slacken these cords will you?”	163
8	3	9	1	To no avail, they stared ahead only mercifully walking a little slower than usual but otherwise ignoring her coldness neither of them had seen towards them before. 	164
8	3	9	2	Tom was used to being well esteemed by all officers and militia in his company. 	80
8	3	9	3	Tom scolded them,  “I’m ordering you to slacken her cords!”	59
8	3	10	1	They didn’t heed him either. 	29
8	3	10	2	Tom started to run after them. 	31
8	3	10	3	Constable Neale pulled him back. 	33
8	3	10	4	In a matter of seconds, the man flew back with his nose bleeding and Tom was running towards her. 	98
8	3	10	5	He came up behind him to lock him from behind around his neck and pulled him to the ground. 	92
8	3	10	6	After the two men had locked Mary inside the coach, they came over to incapacitate him. 	88
8	3	10	7	Constable Neale slugged him in the belly knocking his wind out. 	64
8	3	10	8	Tom’s fight wore quickly from his own struggle with age but he fought so wildly that he was sure he had dislocated most of his limb joints in the fight. 	153
8	3	10	9	Fortunately however for Captain Bradbury, his rank deterred them from taking any formal actions against him or he could have found himself locked up as well if he were their detainee. 	184
8	3	10	10	They also half expected this to happen knowing Captain Bradbury as a very persistent and proud fisted man but who was also easily subdued at his age.	149
8	3	11	1	Tom woke up on dry earth outside his home, dirt coating his tongue which he spat out upon tasting it. 	102
8	3	11	2	He realized he had incapacitated Mary’s own defense by insisting she not use any supernal abilities. 	101
8	3	11	3	He wept, rolling around, cursing himself and beating his head with his hands at his error. 	91
8	3	11	4	He looked up woefully to the horizon in hopes he could spot her.	64
8	3	12	1	Tom spent his mornings alone, angry and adamantly determined to raise a fight against this.  	93
8	3	12	2	He mounted his black steed Shadow and galloped full speed to Major Pike’s home.	79
8	3	13	1	“Tom, I can’t break your anger over this. 	42
8	3	13	2	In fact, I advise you not to but I must break this rashness that has come over you if you are to save your dear wife Mary.”	123
8	3	14	1	“I don’t care what it takes now. 	33
8	3	14	2	If this is God’s way, then I’m afraid it is the Devil I side with.”	67
8	3	15	1	“Don’t say that to anyone else Tom. 	36
8	3	15	2	I don’t want to lose two beloved family friends this year. 	59
8	3	15	3	We’ve suffered enough loss.”	28
8	3	16	1	“You don’t understand! 	23
8	3	16	2	She was the only one in this world I would trust to stop this madness and now what hope do we have?! 	101
8	3	16	3	This is my fault. 	18
8	3	16	4	I should be arrested and she should be released.”	49
8	3	17	1	“Cool your head Tom. 	21
8	3	17	2	We will do what it takes. 	26
8	3	17	3	The Good Lord has given us tests in life and will deliver us if we ask and devote ourselves to His Truth and Reason.”	117
8	3	18	1	“Rob, I would do anything but that means anything to free Mary.”	64
8	3	19	1	“Patience and we will win this fight Tom.”	42
8	3	20	1	A month passed, Tom had been going to visit Mary in jail and getting advice from Major Pike every day. 	103
8	3	20	2	His children and grandchildren were staying with him to relieve him of his usual chores and tried to comfort him. 	114
8	3	20	3	This was a surprising amount of support compared to what he was used to..  	75
8	3	20	4	Mary and Tom were used to sacrificing everything for their children and now he saw them returning the favor.  	110
8	3	20	5	They all offered advice, ideas and stratagem for working out Mary’s release putting trust in God as they had all become very devoutly attendant to their church services.  	171
8	3	20	6	Tom went to Salem to the court and finally was able to view the notice which listed the reasons for her imprisonment:	117
8	3	22	1	George Herrick v. 	18
8	3	22	2	Mary Bradbury, Sarah Rice, Wilmott Reed, and Elizabeth Fosdick	62
8	3	23	1	May 26th 1692	13
8	3	24	1	Beeing at Salem village w'th Constable Josp Neale the persons under written was afflicted much and Complain- ed ag'st viz Mary Walcott Ann Putnam upon Capt Bradberys wife of Salsbury & Mary Walcott Ann Putnam: mrs Marshall upon Goodwife Rice of Reding & Mary Walcott ann Puttnam Marcy Lewis upon Goodwife Read of Marblehead & Mary Walcott Marcy Lewis Ann Puttnam upon Goody Fosdick the same woemen tells them that shee afflicts mr Tufts Negro	442
8	3	26	1	Tom’s ire grew at the reading and re-reading of the notice. 	60
8	3	26	2	He soon realized that he might seriously hurt Mary’s case if he were to lash out in complaint against this justice forsaken institution. 	137
8	3	26	3	His limits were pushed overboard however when he saw this notice:	65
8	3	27	1	Be it here known that Governor Phipps has, under the Dyvine Rights of our Lord and Lady’s Majesty, our King and Queen, henceforth from this day, the twenty-seventh of May, commissioned a Court of Oyer and Terminer in the township of Salem for the hearing and determining of Justice due these many cases here before us which do demand our diligence and Faithfulness and in so doing also hereby appoint by said commission nine Just men to sit in the court thereof as Judges to act on behalf of our Lord and Lady in all holiness and righteousness and sworn by oath over God’s sacred Words, the Holy Bible., Be they also given the rights to swear jurors for the invest of these cases as come before the court to diligently inquire after all cases of treason, felony ...	765
9	1	1	1	The Courthouse was a tall and narrow structure like that of a plantation home for a single man among the city’s hovels.	119
9	1	2	1	The letters on the sign were already fading from the rain. 	59
9	1	2	2	The rain was a welcome relief from the hot sun in early July.  	63
9	1	2	3	The trials first victim, Bridget Bishop had been executed by hanging last month. 	81
9	1	2	4	The day had come for Mary’s examination/hearing from which indictments, investigations and trials would likely be made.	119
9	1	3	1	Tom entered the dim candlelit courtroom to see, on the right side of the court, the accusers: Thomas Putnam Jr, his wife Anne Carr Putnam, their daughter Ann Jr., a young puffy-faced teen whose eyes were already red with crying and some of the other townsfolk of Salem with their daughters, among them Mary Walcott, an older teen, along with her father John Walcott, a widower of several years, her maternal uncle Samuel Sibley and his wife, Aunt Mary Sibley. 	460
9	1	3	2	Tom felt a burning anger seeing Mary Sibley there since he heard from Mary what she threatened her with. 	105
9	1	3	3	Goody Sibley with the Carrs now?	32
9	1	4	1	He looked for his wife on the left side benches. 	49
9	1	4	2	He saw families but none of the accused themselves. 	52
9	1	4	3	He walked up and found the closest seat to them on a bench unoccupied and sat there. 	85
9	1	4	4	He could overhear voices behind him. 	37
9	1	4	5	Every comment he believed held a possible clue as to what the outcome might be. 	80
9	1	4	6	A lady's voice behind him whispered not so quietly, "Finally some law and order around here!"  	95
9	1	4	7	Tom fumed at the hearing of it as he hoped for a better sign. 	62
9	1	4	8	The clerk announced Judge Sewall would be presiding. 	53
9	1	4	9	His face was soft and rounded. 	31
9	1	4	10	Tom didn't know him that well but hoped there was some kindness underlying his demeanor. 	89
9	1	4	11	There was little else to go on. 	32
9	1	4	12	A sheriff soon walked Mary in and kept her standing. 	53
9	1	4	13	As she came in, the girls started to groan, screech and yell at random in a cacophonous stream of protests, Ann Putnam and Mary Walcott were chief among them:	158
9	1	5	1	"Hell fire it burns!"	21
9	1	6	1	"Deliver me from her dear Lord!"	32
9	1	7	1	"Stop Miss Bradbury."	21
9	1	8	1	"Stop tormenting me!"	21
9	1	9	1	"Miss Bradbury! 	16
9	1	9	2	Miss Bradbury! 	15
9	1	9	3	No!"	4
9	1	10	1	"Leave us!"	11
9	1	11	1	"She's choking me!"	19
9	1	12	1	"Look not upon us!"	19
9	1	13	1	"Her gaze it tears my flesh apart!"	35
9	1	14	1	"Take her thither! 	19
9	1	14	2	Away from here please! 	23
9	1	14	3	Go! 	4
9	1	14	4	Please go!"	11
9	1	15	1	Mary turned to face away but then looked at them and they started to go into fits. 	83
9	1	15	2	Every time she even glanced over, they would start up again.	60
9	1	16	1	Judge Sewall tried to stop them in graduating pleas of "Stop this noise!" 	74
9	1	16	2	and finally, "Sheriff, take Mrs Bradbury out."	46
9	1	17	1	"Will those who claim or speak for those who claim injuries by Mrs. 	68
9	1	17	2	Bradbury please step forward?"	30
9	1	18	1	"Who speaks for those injured by Mrs. 	38
9	1	18	2	Bradbury?"	10
9	1	19	1	Thomas Putnam Jr. stepped around the group of girls strewn about the floor. 	76
9	1	19	2	"I do your Honor."	18
9	1	20	1	"Your name for the court?"	26
9	1	21	1	"Thomas Putnam, Jr."	20
9	1	22	1	"What matter do you bring to the court?"	40
9	1	23	1	"I have complaint from John Bibber, my daughter, and Mary Walcott."	67
9	1	24	1	"Will John Bibber take the stand?"	34
9	1	25	1	A young farmer stepped around the girls strewn over the floor.	62
9	1	26	1	"Your name?"	12
9	1	27	1	"John Bibber."	14
9	1	28	1	"What do you do Mr. 	20
9	1	28	2	Bibber."	8
9	1	29	1	"I am a husbandman."	20
9	1	30	1	"What have you to speak before this court?"	43
9	1	31	1	"When my wife, Sarah, saw Mary Bradbury, just now, she got violently ill and shook like she was being tortured just like she did yesterday. 	140
9	1	31	2	She hasn't eaten in days. 	26
9	1	31	3	Now I know who it is that has done this."	41
9	1	32	1	"How long has this been going on good husband?"	47
9	1	33	1	"She was been in pain all times of the day for a long time ever since she went out and saw Mrs. 	96
9	1	33	2	Bradbury at the market. 	24
9	1	33	3	Since she complained that the Devil was tormenting her with pain and she sees a woman that she saw earlier that day coming after her to kill her."	146
9	1	34	1	Tom Putnam Jr revived his daughter Ann and Mary Walcott with a touch and they both came to and stood up slowly. 	112
9	1	34	2	The rest of the girls were still writhing. 	43
9	1	34	3	The judge taking notice motioned them forward in a fatherly way. 	65
9	1	34	4	"Miss Putnam, would you give the names of these girls here afflicted?"	70
9	1	35	1	"Mary Walcott." 	16
9	1	35	2	The judge motioned to the clerk indicating she should speak slow enough for him to record as Ann continued, "Elizabeth Hubbard, Elizabeth Booth, Mercy Lewis"	157
9	1	36	1	"That will do. 	15
9	1	36	2	Who speaks for Mrs. 	20
9	1	36	3	Bradbury?"	10
9	1	37	1	"Captain Bradbury your Honor."	30
9	1	38	1	The clerk continued frantically scribbling and crossing out.  	62
9	1	38	2	The judge ordered Mary back out again and sure enough, the girls went into fits and wailing again.	98
9	1	39	1	After so much needless review of the case, the clerk passed a nod to the judge that enough was there to write proper indictments with. 	135
9	1	39	2	Mary went back to jail and court was dismissed until later in the same month when Tom could finally respond.	108
9	2	1	1	The 21st of July was a record hot Monday in Salisbury. 	55
9	2	1	2	At the Bradbury home, Tom was sitting at his table, a makeshift desk really piled up with papers. 	98
9	2	1	3	Tom Jr ran inside shouting through gasps from being out of breath, “They killed them!”	86
9	2	2	1	“Who killed ...who?”	20
9	2	3	1	“The executioners in Salem hung at least five women just days ago on Gallows Hill.”	83
9	2	4	1	“Who?”	6
9	2	5	1	“Rebecca Nurse, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth Howe, Sarah Good, Sarah Wildes.”	75
9	2	6	1	Tom Sr. looked out the window, his lips quivering and holding back sobs which streamed silently from his eyes instead. 	119
9	2	6	2	More bad omens. 	16
9	2	6	3	Rebecca Nurse was about Mary’s age. 	36
9	2	6	4	He got up and walked to his bed and shut the door behind him. 	62
9	2	6	5	Tom Jr could hear his father weeping in agonizing sorrow within the dark recesses in the corner where his bedroom door stood.	125
9	2	7	1	Hours later, that night, a bloodshot Tom Sr walked back into the room greeted by a larger gathering of his family. 	115
9	2	7	2	Seeing them all, he announced, “Do not fear, do not lose faith. 	64
9	2	7	3	We will petition everyone in this city to testify to our dear Mary’s good name.” 	81
9	2	7	4	Tearful smiles nodded wistfully back at him. 	45
9	2	7	5	He ambled to his desk, lit the candle thereupon and straightway started composing a petition. 	94
9	2	7	6	At the local congregational church where the Bradbury’s regularly went, he got Reverend Allen to spare him some time to  circulate a petition to endorse Mary’s character. 	171
9	2	7	7	He didn’t stop there.  	23
9	2	7	8	He got names off the church rolls and the city map and rode door to door collecting signatures from anyone who opened their door to him. 	137
9	2	7	9	He hoped to get at least a hundred signatures but was pleased to have gotten well over that. 	93
9	2	7	10	It read:	8
9	2	9	1	Deposition for Mary Bradbury	28
9	2	10	1	July 22, 1692	13
9	2	11	1	Concerning Mrs Bradbury’s life and conversation, we the subscribers do testify that it was such as became the gospel she was a lover of the ministry in all appearance and a diligent attender upon God’s holy ordinances, being of a courteous and peaceable disposition and caring. 	278
9	2	11	2	Neither did any of us (some of whom have lived in the town with her above fifty years) ever hear or know that she ever had any difference or falling out with any of her neighbors; man, woman, or child; but was always ready and willing to do for them what lay in her power night and day, though with hazard of	308
9	2	12	1	her health or other danger….	28
9	2	13	1	Under that were the signatures of hundreds of family heads and their wives and a variety of individuals as well. 	113
9	2	13	2	He continued to visit Mary in jail every day. 	46
9	2	13	3	Together they sat together to compose their answers against what he knew would be an indictment of witchcraft.	110
9	2	14	1	The 28th of July was unbearably hot and muggy Monday in Salisbury. 	67
9	2	14	2	At the Bradbury home, Tom was sitting at his table which was piled high with papers he was either working on or had collected.  	128
9	2	14	3	He had earlier gone into Salisbury town center to pick up notices and mail. 	76
9	2	14	4	Sure enough, he had a docket with a couple indictments as he had expected. 	75
9	2	14	5	One of them contained the standard accusations of being afflicted during the examination, the other one however contained a new accusation that Mary’s spectre had afflicted a Timothy Swann:	189
9	2	15	1	“The jurors for our Sovereign Lord and Lady, the King and Queen do present that Mary Bradbury, Wife of Captain Thomas bradbury of Salisbury, in the County of Essex entered upon the Twenty-Sixth day of July in the year aforesaid and divers other days and times as well before as after certain detestable arts called witchcraft and sorceries wickedly, maliciously and feloniously hath used, practiced and exercised at and in the township of Andover in the County of Essex aforesaid in upon and against one Timothy Swann of Andover in the county aforesaid husbandman, by which said wicked acts the said Timothy Swann upon the 26th day of July aforesaid and divers other days and times both before and after was and is tortured, afflicted, consumed, pined, wasted and tormented and also for sundry other acts of witchcraft by the said Mary Bradbury committed and done before and since that time against the peace of our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen, their crown and dignity and the form of the statute in that case made and provided,”	1044
9	2	17	1	Tom reviewed the statement he prepared with Mary’s help and his own alongside the petition he had worked on earlier. 	117
9	2	17	2	Mary’s read:	12
9	2	19	1	July the 28: 1692	17
9	2	20	1	I do plead - not guilty. 	25
9	2	20	2	I am wholly innocent of any such wickedness through the goodness of God that have kept me hitherto.  	101
9	2	20	3	I am the servant of Jesus Christ and have given myself up to him as my only Lord and Savior and to the diligent attendance upon him in all his holy ordinances, in utter contempt and defiance of the devil, and all his works as horrid and detestable and accordingly have endeavored to frame my life and conversation according to the rules of his holy word, and in that faith and practice resolve by the help and assistance of God to continue to my life’s end: for the truth of what I say as to matter of practice I humbly refer myself to my brethren and neighbors that know me and unto the searcher of all hearts for the truth and uprightness of my heart therein: (human frailties and unavoidable infirmities excepted) of which I bitterly complain every day.”	757
9	2	22	1	Tom turned the leaf to read his own statement next:	51
9	2	24	1	July the 28: 1692	17
9	2	25	1	Concerning my beloved wife Mary Bradbury this is that I have to say: we have been married fifty five years: and she hath been a loving and faithful wife to me, unto this day she hath been wonderful  laborious diligent and industrious in her place and employment, about the bringing up of our family (which have been eleven children of our own and four grandchildren: She was both prudent and provident.  	404
9	2	25	2	Of a cheerful spirit liberally charitable: she being now very aged and weak, and grieved under her affliction may not be able to speak much for herself, not being so free of speech as some others may be: I hope her life and conversation hath been such amongst her neighbours as gives a better and more real testimony of her, than can be expressed by words owned by me.	368
9	2	26	1	Thomas Bradbury	15
9	2	28	1	Tom then leafed his statement over and read the Summons they had copied out for all those he would have to defend against. 	123
9	2	28	2	Thomas Putnam Jr. was a formidable opponent in the courtroom. 	62
9	2	28	3	He knew he would have to work overtime to deal with him. 	57
9	2	28	4	Judge Sewall had sent this out. 	32
9	2	28	5	He hoped he would get another judge, someone who might give him more time on the floor to make his case.	104
9	2	30	1	Summons for Witnesses	21
9	2	32	1	William and Mary by the Grace of God of England Scotland France and Ireland, King and Queen defenders of the faith and company, to :	132

9	2	51	1	Richard Carr	12
9	2	52	1	Timothy Swan	12
9	2	53	1	Joseph Ring	11
9	2	55	1	Tom noticed how the list of names seemed to grow. 	50
9	2	55	2	Thomas Putnam Jr.’s work no doubt to stack as many people in the court against Mary as possible. 	97
9	2	55	3	Revenge was a bitter foe and one more intensely evil than anything every witch he had ever known had done.	106
9	2	56	1	The month of August was a long and bitterly torrid one. 	56
9	2	56	2	Tom had sweat through piles of handkerchiefs over long days of visits to the Ipswich gaol, the courthouses and potential supporting witnesses. 	143
9	2	56	3	He wanted to obtain a surprise witness so he went to the town ordinaries often to listen to the daily problems of Ipswich and Salisbury folks hoping to hear of dissents within the ranks of the Carr, Putnam and Endicott families.	228
9	2	57	1	Halfway through August on an overcast and muggy day in Ipswich, Tom rode up to the gaol and hitched his tired steed and let him drink. 	135
9	2	57	2	He was such a regular visitor, the guards would wave him through.	65
9	2	58	1	“Tom!” 	7
9	2	58	2	Mary’s face lit up as it always did. 	37
9	2	58	3	While her cell was better than most, her loneliness was a painful one nearing six months.	89
9	2	59	1	“I have been working all day on getting you out of this rat’s nest.”	68
9	2	60	1	“It’s no use Tom, I’m an aged woman well past my time for death. 	65
9	2	60	2	This is my lot in life.”	24
9	2	61	1	“No. 	5
9	2	61	2	You’re not just any aged woman. 	32
9	2	61	3	You’re Mary Perkins.”	21
9	2	62	1	“Save the others then.”	23
9	2	63	1	“If I could, I would. 	22
9	2	63	2	Major Pike is trying to convince Increase Mather of the evils of all this. 	75
9	2	63	3	Mary, I want to unbind you from your oath. 	43
9	2	63	4	I want you to practice your love for God the way you see fit. 	62
9	2	63	5	If it is not malicious, it is in your purview and your God given freedom to devote yourself the ways he gives you, not anyone else.”	132
9	2	64	1	On Tuesday the 19th of August, more bad news arrived. 	54
9	2	64	2	One more goodwife and several of the colony’s prominent men had been executed on Gallows Hill. 	95
9	2	64	3	Among them were: Martha Carrier, George Jacobs Sr., George Burroughs, John Willard and John Proctor. 	101
9	2	64	4	George Burroughs had been a good friend of his who lived up in Wells Maine. 	76
9	2	64	5	The warrant for his arrest had been a tricky one for the constables to execute. 	80
9	2	64	6	He was reputedly strong and slippery but even he was not spared. 	65
9	2	64	7	His heart sank in the despairing thought of it momentarily but he decided to keep his hopes up through his own efforts and schemes. 	132
9	2	64	8	He had powerful connections and a powerful wife too-- if  only he could just release her from the obligation to avoid the appearances of magic.	143
9	2	65	1	On Friday the 5th of September a great rainstorm blew through Salem. 	69
9	2	65	2	The roads become little ponds between the knolls. 	50
9	2	65	3	Inside the Court of Oyer and Terminer, Mary was lead to the accused’s seat once again and Tom was there with his friend Major Pike and his family to present a better show of numbers in the courtroom. 	200
9	2	65	4	Judge Sewall was there again, in a more sour mood than he was last time.	72
9	2	66	1	“Major Pike, I take it you will be presenting the case for Mary Bradbury today?”	80
9	2	67	1	“Yes your Honor.”	17
9	2	68	1	“I read the petition and the answer to the indictments and while these are all noteworthy, are there any ecclesiastic or expert testimonies for the character of Mrs. 	166
9	2	68	2	Bradbury given in their own words?”	35
9	2	69	1	“There are not, but if this is to be a fair and just trial, then the investigation has not concluded. 	102
9	2	69	2	I know there are those who would provide such a testimony that the court has requested here.”	93
9	2	70	1	Judge Sewall wrung his hands and looked over at the accused side. 	66
9	2	70	2	Many of the witnesses summoned did not show. 	45
9	2	70	3	“Mr. 	5
9	2	70	4	Putnam, how many are with you to witness today?”	48
9	2	71	1	Thomas Putnam Jr. held the hand of his young teenage daughter Ann who looked at the Bradburys in disgust and the hand of his wife Ann Sr. on his left.	150
9	2	72	1	“The storm kept many of them away your Honor. 	46
9	2	72	2	I move that we try the date of September 9th, two days from now.”	65
9	2	73	1	“Court is adjourned,” as the judge pounded the gavel, albeit, more gently than usual.	85
9	2	74	1	After visiting his wife in jail, Tom went to the home of James Allen the reverend to obtain an ecclesiastic expert testimony for his wife. 	139
9	2	74	2	Major Pike and his brother John also added their testimonies.  	63
9	2	74	3	They signed their names and mutually witnessed it at the courthouse in Salisbury where they both had occasion to sit in the judgement seat. 	140
9	2	74	4	Land exchanges and witchcraft were frequent business of the day and they spent the following three days preparing to testify for Mary if Thomas Putnam Jr. should return with witnesses.	184
9	2	75	1	Tuesday, the 9th of September finally arrived and a great ensemble was present for all the cases that had built up during the storm at the court in Salem.  	156
9	2	75	2	Their case was actually heard late in the day by Judge Stoughton.	65
9	2	76	1	“We’ll now begin the case of Putnam and Walcott vs Bradbury.”	61
9	2	77	1	Tom delivered the testimony of James Allen to the judge. 	57
9	2	77	2	The judge took one dismissive glance at it and put it aside.  	62
9	2	77	3	Tom insisted that it be read for the jurors to hear.	52
9	2	78	1	“Is this not a court of hearing and trial still? 	49
9	2	78	2	Judge Sewall had inquired after this form of testimony for Mrs. 	64
9	2	78	3	Bradbury.”	10
9	2	79	1	“Go ahead and read it then,” he yawned.	39
9	2	80	1	Tom read the document entirely:	31
9	2	81	1	“Being desirous to give my testimony concerning the life and conversation of Mrs. 	82
9	2	81	2	Bradbury of Salisbury amongst us which is as followeth:	55
9	2	82	1	I having lived nine years at Salisbury, in the work of the ministry and now four years in the office of pastor, to my best notice and observation of Mrs. 	154
9	2	82	2	Bradbury, she hath lived according to the rules of the Gospel amongst us; was a constant attender upon the ministry of the word, and all the ordinances of the gospel full of works of charity and mercy to the sick and poor; neither have I seen or heard anything of her unbecoming the profession of the gospel.	308
9	2	83	1	James Allen	11
9	2	85	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	85	2	James Allen made oath to the truth of what is above written September the 7th, 1692 before me Robert Pike, Asst.	112
9	2	86	1	I do also affirm to the truth of what is above testified upon upward of fifty years experience and shall so testify if opportunity do present which I shall endeavor.	165
9	2	87	1	Robert Pike.	12
9	2	89	1	Having lived many years in Salisbury and been much conversant there, according to my best notice and observation of Mrs. 	121
9	2	89	2	Bradbury, I must needs affirm to what is above written and add my oath to it if called thereto.	95
9	2	90	1	John Pike”	10
9	2	92	1	When he finished reading, he passed it up to the clerk for the record of the court.	83
9	2	93	1	Thomas Putnam Jr. smiled and said, I also have testimony which I obtained I would ask for the court’s fairness in allowing me to read the statement of my daughter in her own words. 	181
9	2	93	2	He read:	8
9	2	95	1	The deposition of Ann putnam who testifieth and saith that: I being at Andover on the 26 day of July 1692, I saw there Miss Mary Bradbury, the wife of Captain Thomas Bradbury of Salisbury or	190
9	2	96	1	her Appearance, most grievously afflicting and tormenting Timothy Swan of Andover almost ready to kill him also several times before and since that time I have seen Mrs. 	170
9	2	96	2	Bradbury or her Appearance most grievously afflicting Timothy Swann and I believe that Mrs. 	92
9	2	96	3	Bradbury is a most dreadful witch for since she has been in prison she or her Appearance has come to me and most grievously afflicted me, Ann Putnam owned before the grand inquest - this here evidence to be the true one the oath that she hath taken: this: 8 day of September 1692	279
9	2	97	1	Ann Putnam”	11
9	2	99	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	99	2	Putnam handed his document to the clerk and smiled at the judge. 	65
9	2	99	3	Judge Stoughton did not return it.	34
9	2	100	1	“We will now hear from your witnesses Mr. 	42
9	2	100	2	Putnam.”	8
9	2	101	1	“I would like to call to the stand Mr. 	39
9	2	101	2	Samuel Endicott.”	17
9	2	102	1	After Mr. 	10
9	2	102	2	Endicott took oath and answered the initial identifying questions of his age, residence and occupation and verification of his identification of the accused being the same has for his complaint, Mr. 	199
9	2	102	3	Putnam inquired of his witness,  “Mr. 	38
9	2	102	4	Endicott, please tell us your account of the affliction Mrs. 	61
9	2	102	5	Bradbury tormented you with.”	29
9	2	103	1	“Eleven years ago, I was on voyage out to see with Captain Samuel Smith, who has since deceased.  	98
9	2	103	2	Just before we sailed, Mrs. 	28
9	2	103	3	Bradbury, the prisoner now at the bar came to Boston with some firkins of butter. 	82
9	2	103	4	Captain Smith bought two firkins, one of them only half finished churning and after we had been at sea three weeks, our men were not able to eat it. 	149
9	2	103	5	It stank so much it was run throughout with maggots which made the men very much disturbed about it and would often say that they heard Mrs. 	141
9	2	103	6	Bradbury was a witch and that they verily believed she was so or else she would not have served the Captain such butter.”	121
9	2	104	1	Ann Putnam turned her nose up and audibly gave a long “ew” to the mention of maggots. 	86
9	2	104	2	She started her fits again. 	28
9	2	104	3	Her mother lifted her dragging body up and discretely smacked her on the behind.	80
9	2	105	1	“Order!” 	9
9	2	105	2	he shouted at them, “Continue Mr. 	34
9	2	105	3	Endicott.”	10
9	2	106	1	“Four days after we set sail, we were met with such a violent storm that we lost our main mast and riggin’ and had to throw overboard fifteen horses. 	150
9	2	106	2	After about a fortnight, after we set our jury mast, that very night there came up a ship by our side and carried away two of the mizzen shrouds and one of the leaches of the mainsail.”	185
9	2	107	1	This time, the whole group of girls were dropping to the floor and fainting and some laughing with a loud hysterical cackle. 	125
9	2	107	2	Eyes darted in their direction and after some pause and threatening glares, they slowly ceased.	95
9	2	108	1	“After we arrived in Barbados we went to Saltitudos and had laden our vessel the next morning, she sprang a leak in the hold which wasted several tons of salt insomuch that we were forced to unladen our vessel again wholly to stop our leak and there was then four feet of water in the hold after had taken in our lading again, we had a good passage home but when we came near the land the Captain sent me forward to look out for land in a bright moon shining night and as I was sitting on the windlass, I heard a rumbling noise under me. 	538
9	2	108	2	I looked on the side of the windlass and saw the legs of Mrs Bradbury.”	71
9	2	109	1	Tom jumped in, “Objection!”	27
9	2	110	1	The judge nodded automatically after a nudge from the clerk. 	61
9	2	110	2	Tom continued, “How could you tell it was my good wife Mrs. 	60
9	2	110	3	Bradbury if you only saw the legs?”	35
9	2	111	1	This made Mr. 	14
9	2	111	2	Endicott growl angrily, “As I shooed and hollered at the legs, the did not move and could not be affrighted. 	109
9	2	111	3	I was shaking and when I looked over my shoulder, I saw the rest of the appearance of a woman from her middle upwards, having a white cap and a white neckcloth as Mrs. 	168
9	2	111	4	Bradbury would wear which frightened me very much and as I was turning of the windlass, I saw the aforesaid two legs again.”	124
9	2	112	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	112	2	Putnam grew concerned and jumped in with “Thank you Mr. 	56
9	2	112	3	Endicott.”	10
9	2	113	1	Judge Stoughton then nodded to the defense, you may speak or address the witness.	81
9	2	114	1	Tom sat silent a moment trying to consider the options. 	56
9	2	114	2	He addressed the court fearing more time with the witnesses would just lead to more lies.	89
9	2	115	1	“It is true that my wife sold Captain Smith two firkins of butter. 	67
9	2	115	2	It may or may not be true that her butter was of inferior quality that day or if Captain Smith merely stored it in an improperly wet part of the ship. 	151
9	2	115	3	We do know the ship had leaks which would make the butter seem half-churned. 	77
9	2	115	4	The evidence for Mary causing storms, leaks, loss of horses and appearing on the ship is a falsehood motivated by Mr. 	118
9	2	115	5	Endicott’s frailties of mind and habit of blaming all misfortunes on those he has found fault with or wishes to discredit in business.  	136
9	2	115	6	It is commonly known that storms can arise from the Caribbean. 	63
9	2	115	7	How do we know if that is evidence of witchcraft or evidence of Nature other than by the perceptions of Mr. 	108
9	2	115	8	Endicott which are fallible as we all are?”	43
9	2	116	1	After this passioned speech continued, many were nodding in agreement with his apt ability for rhetoric. 	105
9	2	116	2	Major Pike continued to criticize the way Mr. 	46
9	2	116	3	Putnam questioned and posed further questions that would illuminate other more likely possibilities for Mr. 	108
9	2	116	4	Endicott’s loss and his bitter character.	41
9	2	117	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	117	2	Putnam scowled but soon lit up as the judge gave him the floor back at which he then brought Mary Warren up to the stand, “I now present Mary Warren for questions.”	164
9	2	118	1	Mary answered the usual starting questions and was examined with questions.	75
9	2	119	1	“Mary, how long have you been afflicted by Mrs. 	48
9	2	119	2	Bradbury?”	10
9	2	120	1	“A long long time.”	19
9	2	121	1	“When did this happen?”	23
9	2	122	1	“It was that day we were here last time.”	41
9	2	123	1	“How did you know it was Mrs. 	30
9	2	123	2	Bradbury?”	10
9	2	124	1	“She told me her name was Miss Bradbury and that she came from Salisbury.”	74
9	2	125	1	“Is it the same woman sitting there?”	37
9	2	126	1	“Yes it is.”	12
9	2	127	1	“Objection!” 	13
9	2	127	2	interrupted Tom, “How does she look at her now and answer so peacefully?”	73
9	2	128	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	128	2	Putnam nodded at her and mouthed a few words which the judge nor Tom caught. 	77
9	2	128	3	“What did she do to you?”	25
9	2	129	1	“She did most grievously afflict me and torment me that day but if she looked upon me, she would strike me down or almost choke me. 	132
9	2	129	2	Also, it was not always her but sometimes her appearance that would afflict me.”	80
9	2	130	1	“Did she afflict anyone else?”	30
9	2	131	1	“Oh yes, her appearance most grievously afflicted and tormented Mary Walcott, Sarah Bibber, Elizabeth Hubbard and Ann Putnam.”	126
9	2	132	1	“And do you believe this is because Mrs. 	41
9	2	132	2	Bradbury is a witch?”	21
9	2	133	1	“Objection! 	12
9	2	133	2	Leading..”	10
9	2	134	1	“Overruled Mr. 	15
9	2	134	2	Bradbury. 	10
9	2	134	3	Continue.”	10
9	2	135	1	“And do you believe she could afflict you so much because Mrs. 	63
9	2	135	2	Bradbury is a witch who does the Devil’s work?”	47
9	2	136	1	“I believe in my heart that Miss Bradbury is a witch and that she has very often afflicted and tormented me and several others by her acts of witchcraft.”	154
9	2	137	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	137	2	Putnam put Sarah Bibber and Elizabeth Hubbard on the stand after and their testimonies were almost a pure copy cat of Miss Warren’s in both tone and claims. 	157
9	2	137	3	Tom flatly refuted their testimonies as a lie prepared by the prosecution but was quickly reprimanded by judge Stoughton who took a lot of sympathy with the young girls.  	171
9	2	137	4	Mr. 	4
9	2	137	5	Putnam then brought Richard Carr followed by Zerubbabel Endicott having lost a chance to answer.	96
9	2	138	1	“Mr. 	5
9	2	138	2	Carr, please give us an account of what happened.”	50
9	2	139	1	Richard Carr, a young man in his thirties with dirty brown hair spoke in a slight Scottish brogue Mary distastefully remembered, “Thirteen years ago after some differences that happened to be between my Honored father, Mr. 	223
9	2	139	2	George Carr and the prisoner…” He gave the account of George seeing the blue boar which gave Tom and Mary pause. 	113
9	2	139	3	They knew what had happened there and he completely omitted the motives for his visit by George Carr but of course he would, he was too young. 	143
9	2	139	4	The testimony was brief and simplified. 	40
9	2	139	5	Zerubbabel Endicott, son of the doctor by the same name, was much more clean cut in his appearance and dark haired like his grandfather. 	137
9	2	139	6	He had a sly tone to his voice. 	32
9	2	139	7	He repeated the same story that their father went up and saw Mary Bradbury appear as a blue boar with the same face as Mary. 	125
9	2	139	8	He further mentioned how as they went home, they spent the entire way back discussing it. 	90
9	2	139	9	Mary had no idea the boar had given them the impression of her appearance and was afraid of how accurate it sounded but they also highlighted “boar” in such an insulting manner and almost jokingly. 	198
9	2	139	10	Mary wasn’t sure exactly what happened there except that she knew of the boar and that she was spared and that she had a box whose curiosity was beyond her reckoning. 	167
9	2	139	11	She didn’t remember Zerubbabel being there at all.	50
9	2	140	1	Tom played off the whole thing as preposterous but that wild hogs are a frequent occurrence on their farms and that a hot day could cause anyone to see a hog or a boar more fantastic than it really was and that boars are naturally known to charge and eat out of the waste piles left out for the hogs.	300
9	2	141	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	141	2	Putnam was allowed next to call up James Carr who recounted the course treatment he suffered at the hands of Mrs. 	114
9	2	141	3	Rebecca Williams Bradbury who was now deceased. 	48
9	2	141	4	He didn’t even mention that she had since deceased so little did he actually seem to care for her. 	99
9	2	141	5	This matter was set right by Tom who explained that this was not evidence of being “behagged” as he was quoting Dr. 	116
9	2	141	6	Crosby of saying of Mary.	25
9	2	142	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	142	2	Putnam took pains to question Mary Walcott, niece-in-law to that demon specialist Mary Sibley and co-conspirator with Ann Jr. 	126
9	2	142	3	After swearing her in and asking her name and such, he asked her, “Miss Walcott, what happened on the day of July 26th this year?”	130
9	2	143	1	“I was in Andover and saw Mary Bradbury, the wife of Captain Thomas Bradbury of Salisbury or her appearance most grievously afflicting and tormenting Timothy Swann of Andover almost ready to kill him. 	201
9	2	143	2	Also, before and since that time, I have seen her do the same.”	63
9	2	144	1	“Do you believe, Mrs. 	22
9	2	144	2	Bradbury, who sits there, is truly a witch?”	44
9	2	145	1	“I do believe in my heart that Miss Bradbury is a most dreadful witch since she has been in prison, her appearance has come to me and tormented me also.”	153
9	2	146	1	“That is enough Miss Walcott.”	30
9	2	147	1	“We shall have an hour’s recess,” announced judge Stoughton.	60
9	2	148	1	Everyone walked outside the courthouse to get some warm sun. 	61
9	2	148	2	William Carr had been in the standing room since the court was packed. 	71
9	2	148	3	Tom introduced William to Major Pike who shook his hand.	56
9	2	149	1	“Major Pike, I have Mr. 	24
9	2	149	2	William Carr here who has been disaffected with James and Richard Carr since they have excluded him and bullied him so into lying for them which he refuses to do. 	163
9	2	149	3	He is a good man and has said he would be willing to testify for us.”	69
9	2	150	1	“That’s most blessed news Captain. 	35
9	2	150	2	Let’s add his testimony to the ordering for the judge. 	55
9	2	150	3	I’ll go submit him now.”	24
9	2	151	1	After recess, the judge entered as everyone was still standing. 	64
9	2	151	2	The sheriff then seated everyone.	33
9	2	152	1	“We’ll now hear the testimony of William Carr. 	47
9	2	152	2	You may proceed Mr. 	20
9	2	152	3	Bradbury.”	10
9	2	153	1	Gasps were heard all around the room and taunting was shouted incoherently against the brother.	95
9	2	154	1	Mr. 	4
9	2	154	2	Bradbury began his standard set of questions and discovered him to be about 41 years old, and very youthful looking for his age. 	129
9	2	154	3	He had a straw colored hair with a reddened shadow of beard and blue eyes that looked very similar to George Carr’s but much kinder and innocent.	145
9	2	155	1	“Please tell us the story of how John Carr died?”	49
9	2	156	1	William’s Scottish brogue matched that of the family but also carried the speech of the unlearned in his voice. 	112
9	2	156	2	Apparently, the had also neglected him when it came to good education--much to Tom’s concern. 	94
9	2	156	3	He spoke up after a pause, “My brother, was younger and of as good a capacity as most men his age. 	99
9	2	156	4	It was then that he fell in love with Jane True, now with Captain John March. 	78
9	2	156	5	My father, being persuaded by some of the family, which I shall not name, not to let him marry so young, would not give him a portion whereupon the match broke of which my brother laid so much to heart that he grew melancholy and by degrees, much crazed not being the man that he was before to his dying day.”	309
9	2	157	1	“Objection, he is lying!”	25
9	2	158	1	“Overruled! 	12
9	2	158	2	Continue Mr. 	13
9	2	158	3	Carr.”	6
9	2	159	1	“I do further testify, that….”, he paused long seized by a moment of fear, “I do further testify, that my said brother was sick about a fortnight or three weeks and then died. 	176
9	2	159	2	I was present with him when he died and do affirm that he died peaceably and quietly never manifesting the least trouble in the world about anybody nor did not say anything Mrs Bradbury nor anybody else doing him hurt and yet I was with him till the breath of life was out of his body.”	286
9	2	160	1	A soft roar of murmurs were echoing through the courtroom. 	59
9	2	160	2	Judge Stoughton pounded his gavel several times in threat. 	59
9	2	160	3	Mr. 	4
9	2	160	4	Putnam was busy coaching Ann and Miss Walcott for their next performance.	73
9	2	161	1	“Mr. 	5
9	2	161	2	Putnam, you may proceed with your witnesses.”	45
9	2	162	1	“I would like to have Samuel Endicott take my place at this time so as to question my daughter.”	96
9	2	163	1	“Come forward.”	15
9	2	164	1	“I would like to bring back Ann Putnam and Mary Walcott back to the stand for a recording of testimony and answers to questions I would like to ask them.”	154
9	2	165	1	Tom knew Miss Walcott by now would surely back what Ann said in detail, the only difference being how much personal livestock had supposedly suffered. 	151
9	2	165	2	Ann followed suit with the account of Mary’s examination day and how the accused Mary had struck all her friends “by her acts of witchcraft” but then added in refutation of William Carr’s testimony by saying, “Also, my uncle John Carr appeared to me in a winding sheet whom I very well knew in his lifetime.”	308
9	2	166	1	“What did he tell you?”	23
9	2	167	1	“He told me that Miss Bradbury had murdered him and that his blood did cry for vengeance against her.”	102
9	2	168	1	“Did Mrs. 	10
9	2	168	2	Bradbury say anything when she appeared to you?” 	49
9	2	168	3	he grinned widely.	18
9	2	169	1	“Her appearance told me that it was she that made my father’s sheep to run away so that they were all lost and that she had killed my father’s heifer and also killed that horse that he took such delight in.”	207
9	2	170	1	Mary Bradbury took the bait and yelled, “You liar Miss Putnam.  	64
9	2	170	2	How is it that you hate the Lord so much as to bear false witness against your neighbor? 	89
9	2	170	3	I have never come near your home, nor did I even know what lays down in your barn.”	83
9	2	171	1	“Mrs Bradbury!” 	16
9	2	171	2	shouted judge Stoughton.	24
9	2	172	1	“That is all your honor, I object to this personal attack that which if I refuse not would make you all to think I did these detestable things to this girl I hardly know.”	171
9	2	173	1	Stoughton seemed impressed and irate at the same time if that was possible. 	76
9	2	173	2	His face was a frozen grimace of disgust at everything but his eyebrow raised slightly and ambiguously upon his clay like brow.	127
9	2	174	1	Mary Walcott’s testimony was starting to bore the judge to tears at this point. 	80
9	2	174	2	Thankfully for him, there were no more witnesses or depositions to order up to the stand. 	90
9	2	174	3	Mary’s trial had been recorded and they took a final recess but with the doors shut and guarded as the judge went to the chambers by himself.	141
9	2	175	1	After the recess, Judge Stoughton walked stiffly and gently back to his chair and read a paper handed to him from a clerk who apparently took his dictation in the chamber, copied from another paper. 	199
9	2	175	2	He read it aloud: “Mary Bradbury, wife of Captain Thomas Bradbury, having heard the testimonies presented both for and against you, and after a due consideration of evidence, this court has determined the verdict on the accusations made against you, in that Mary Bradbury is … “, he paused uncomfortably but raised his eyes up for a moment staring across the heads of the court with his expressionless face and voice, “guilty of all the accusations made in that she was found to be committing ….Sundry Acts of Witchcraft and Sorceries as forbidden by law and therefore subject to any penalties prescribed and justly passed in sentence for your crime.”	651
9	2	176	1	He spoke aside to the clerk to indicate all the extra wording he would need to put on a verdict with the same empty tone.  	123
9	2	176	2	His seriousness seemed to be the product of many self-corrections on any display of humanity in the course of his pious personal and religious life.  	150
9	2	176	3	Mary wondered at this feeling she had better odds at getting boars to fly with her on their back than getting this man to show any expression. 	143
9	2	176	4	Even so, she held out hope she would be spared, even though she knew it was also unprecedented.	95
9	2	177	1	Judge Stoughton, pounded the gavel.  	37
9	2	177	2	He paused and stared at the people in the room with the same expression he used to go out and check on livestock. 	114
9	2	177	3	He turned a page leaf and scanned the paper a moment before reading again, “On this day, the 9th of September, 1692, Having heard many witnesses and found the defendant guilty and convicted of Sundry Acts of Witchcraft and Sorceries, maliciously and feloniously used against the plaintiffs aforesaid and in defiance of the Crown, it is the Judgement of this court that Mary Bradbury is hereby sentenced to die by hanging at the gallows which is to be carried out on the 22nd day of September of this year, 1692 of our Lord.”	524
9	2	178	1	Mary’s face sunk, eyes cast deeply into the ground she thought herself soon to lie in.  	88
9	2	178	2	Tears welled but did not flow, her eyes already dried from the thirst she endured in her cell.   	97
9	2	178	3	The court sat in silent awe of the cruelty in his look.  	57
9	2	178	4	Sniffles could be heard from her side of the aisle. 	52
9	2	178	5	Her mind scattered and flurried with worrisome thoughts.	56
9	2	179	1	Judge Stoughton pounded his gavel again, “Court Dismissed.”	59
10	1	1	1	Iron rusted the thick bars into pitted shards of red and black.	63
10	1	2	1	The wood floors were damp. 	27
10	1	2	2	Wild slimy mushrooms grew in the darkest corner of the cell. 	61
10	1	2	3	A sudden clamour and the distant voice of a guard rattled in monotone: “State your business.”  	95
10	1	2	4	Ipswich’s cells echoed randomly followed by squeaking rats.	59
10	1	3	1	“I’m here to visit Mary Bradbury.”	34
10	1	4	1	“Who are you?”	14
10	1	5	1	“Captain Thomas Bradbury, her husband.”	39
10	1	6	1	The guard called to another guard.	34
10	1	7	1	“Wait here”	11
10	1	8	1	What seemed about an hour passed.	33
10	1	9	1	“This way”	10
10	1	10	1	All the prisoners had been taken from the common area and put back in cells.  	78
10	1	10	2	The guard led him to her.  	27
10	1	10	3	Captain Bradbury motioned that he wished some privacy and launched into dull conversations about chilblains on cows. 	117
10	1	10	4	Sure enough, it worked. 	24
10	1	10	5	They were alone.	16
10	1	11	1	“Thomas, don’t break me out, they have orders to shoot anyone down seen escaping.  	83
10	1	11	2	They have muskets, I’m not fast on my feet anymore.”	52
10	1	12	1	“We have to get you out, the punishments have gotten worse. 	60
10	1	12	2	They just pressed Corey Giles for not entering a plea.  	56
10	1	12	3	He was squirming for two whole days under giant stone weights.  	64
10	1	12	4	He was not delivered.”	22
10	1	13	1	Mary’s jaw slowly dropped in utter shock, turning pale on top of the pale she already had.	90
10	1	14	1	“Jacob is worried for you.”	27
10	1	15	1	“He’s looking even older than I am.” jested Mary.	49
10	1	16	1	Thomas caught off guard gave a hearty chuckle but continued  “It may very well be so but he has always looked up to you and can’t bear the thought of you here and he’s been around the courts long enough to know that a little favor in the right hands can bring down any wall.”	275
10	1	17	1	“Don’t risk Jacob, he’s the only brother I have left and has a large estate to lose. 	85
10	1	17	2	Those poor children of his, what would they do?  	49
10	1	17	3	What if the courts will pay double. 	36
10	1	17	4	We have to do something or they will kill the rest of the town off and there will be no one but those Sisters of Deceit left!  	127
10	1	17	5	I hope Samuel Willard will come through.  	42
10	1	17	6	I need you to send a message to Maria Cotton, an anonymous one, she’ll know what she has to do.  	97
10	1	17	7	She is one of the most important good witches of this land and she has to get through to her thick husband Increase to stop this madness and to bend Cottons arm to bring this to a close.  	188
10	1	17	8	I will help you compose it.  	29
10	1	17	9	She could be next.”	19
10	1	18	1	“What about Reverend John Hale?”	32
10	1	19	1	“I have a plan there. 	22
10	1	19	2	Mary Herrick is easily fooled and not to keen on Sarah Hale.  	62
10	1	19	3	I think John will soon change his tune if Sarah Hale is accused.  	66
10	1	19	4	People who live in straw huts shouldn’t throw rocks!”	53
10	1	20	1	The 21st day of September came and there were no visitors that day.  	69
10	1	20	2	Mary looked forlorn, hopeful.  	31
10	1	20	3	She knew her brother far too well.  	36
10	1	20	4	If he did come, she’d need his help.  	38
10	1	20	5	She got down and put her palms on the ground.  	47
10	1	20	6	The water level rose outside on the ground approaching the jail.  	66
10	1	20	7	A mist covered the ground.	26
10	1	21	1	She saw two shadows in the distance approaching with a third and a fourth. 	75
10	1	21	2	They suddenly came into view.  	31
10	1	21	3	It was Jacob, Thomas and two strong men who looked familiar followed behind.  	78
10	1	21	4	There was the hiss of acid on the hinges.  	43
10	1	21	5	Bubbles and more bubbles.  	27
10	1	21	6	Mary closed her eyes in a prayer.  	35
10	1	21	7	They pulled at the door, supporting it and it slid off the hinge after which they set it down with a thud.  	108
10	1	21	8	As they left, a question burned in Mary’s mind.  	49
10	1	21	9	“How did they get past the two guards?”  	41
10	1	21	10	She would soon know.	20
10	1	22	1	One of the guards was asleep, the other nowhere to be found.  	62
10	1	22	2	Jacob held up a bottle of wine.	31
10	1	23	1	They walked down a path and there they helped Mary into the cart.  	67
10	1	23	2	Thomas spoke: “First stop, Amesbury.”	37
10	1	24	1	The sound of horses could be heard clopping the ground gently in a slow stealthy walking gait. 	95
10	1	24	2	The long dark brown faces of three military grade geldings parted the mist soon to be followed by the brim shadowed face of Samuel Endicott, Marshal George Herrick and another man with a black kerchief on his face holding a new musket.	235
10	1	25	1	Wasting no time, Jacob leaped into the cart, partially loaded with food supplies where Mary had nested herself and stumbled around until he was side by side with his sister.  	175
10	1	25	2	A large canvas was still rolled up and tied with rope.	54
10	1	26	1	“Hold on tight!”	16
10	1	27	1	With that Mary and Jacob held onto the front wall of the cart as Captain Thomas leapt over the saddle and shouted his horse into a deliberate canter keeping the cart steady behind him on the trail.  	199
10	1	27	2	Mary closed her eyes and then opened one.  	43
10	1	27	3	The mist ahead of Captain Thomas cleared for him and she could see they were now taking a trail that went by rocky ledges and outcroppings over the water.	154
10	1	28	1	*Boom-Pow-w-ww!” 	17
10	1	28	2	echoed the musket shot.	23
10	1	29	1	The sound of a full gallop could be heard behind him.  	55
10	1	29	2	Mary concentrated to obscure their trail but her concentration was weak.  	74
10	1	29	3	Clouds of fog rolled back and forth behind them but the gallops got closer.  	77
10	1	29	4	They could hear their direction.  	34
10	1	29	5	Soon again, Mary and Jacob could make out the shadows of the three riders and indiscernible yelling between the men.  	118
10	1	29	6	Thomas dared not look behind him but put all his faith in the path forward. 	76
10	1	29	7	It seemed hours had passed in those few minutes.  	50
10	1	29	8	Every second of safety cherished and given due gratitude to every supernal resident of Heaven and Earth.	104
10	1	30	1	“Powww-w-w” another shot fired, this time the spray of dust just under hoof and wheel. 	87
10	1	30	2	Jacob’s heart was beating frantically and his whispers thanking the Lord could be heard again.  	96
10	1	30	3	Boldened by the narrow miss, Jacob acted quick handing Mary some rope used to tie down several firkins and crates full of pots. 	128
10	1	30	4	He then took the canvas and threw it down.  	44
10	1	30	5	One of the horses had nose-dived into the ground issuing a little geyser of mud.  	82
10	1	30	6	Jacob, grateful he got one was still not secure in his situation.  	67
10	1	30	7	There were two horses and riders left and they were closing in quickly.  	73
10	1	30	8	They were now in face view.  	29
10	1	30	9	Marshal Herrick was out of the group, just the musketman and Samuel left.  	75
10	1	30	10	Mary saw time slow further, watching in fear as if watching herself in a dream as the man with the musket took aim directly at her.  	133
10	1	30	11	For seconds, she felt unsure what to do.  	42
10	1	30	12	She handed Jacob a pot.  	25
10	1	30	13	He threw down one of the pots towards their feet until it shattered, but it didn’t go far enough.  	99
10	1	30	14	The musket man’s horse leapt over it forcing him to grab the reins and bridle and lose his aim. 	96
10	1	30	15	The jolt almost disarmed him but the musket held on by a cord over his arm.   	78
10	1	30	16	Mary slipped down behind crates taking cover and Jacob motioned her to give him another pot.  	94
10	1	30	17	She handed him another pot, this time Jacob aimed higher.  	59
10	1	30	18	He missed again, off to his side.  	35
10	1	30	19	Samuel rode behind him ordering and yelling at him seeming as if to ask him to take aim again.  	96
10	1	30	20	Jacob grabbed another pot from the crate seeing where Mary had gotten it from.  	80
10	1	30	21	Just as Samuel was yelling at him, Jacob threw another pot, this one hitting the horse in the head and just nicking the musket which fired again but into the air.  	164
10	1	30	22	The shock made the horse leap and throw the musket man over the side.  	71
10	1	30	23	It ran alongside the other horse, not rejoining its rider.  	60
10	1	30	24	The musket man could be heard screaming in some pain.  	55
10	1	30	25	Jacob looked very relieved as the musket was taken out.  	57
10	1	30	26	As fast as the cart went, it could not match a carted horse.  	62
10	1	30	27	Samuel got within eye view of Jacob and Mary. 	46
10	1	30	28	He yelled at them now.	22
10	1	31	1	“I will see to it you burn in hell with me you witch!  	55
10	1	31	2	I’ll kill all of you myself!”	29
10	1	32	1	Samuel was unarmed but much younger than Jacob, herself or her husband.  	73
10	1	32	2	He was much more able bodied and capable of murder.  	53
10	1	32	3	Mary slid completely onto her back and behind a firkin.  	57
10	1	32	4	She tried to kick it but to no avail. 	38
10	1	32	5	It was heavy and did not completely vault the back rail of the cart.	68
10	1	33	1	“You can’t hide from me you infernal Devils!  	46
10	1	33	2	I will drag you behind my horse Mary”	37
10	1	34	1	As he spoke again, she kicked the firkin again, this time, it went over the cart, bursting into staves hoops and butter.	120
10	1	35	1	“Once again you lie Mr. 	24
10	1	35	2	Endicott!” 	11
10	1	35	3	she yelled back, just as his horse tried to unsuccessfully parry the mess.  	76
10	1	35	4	It tried to jump but slid on its back legs, tripping and slipping in the butter and finally toppling sideways it’s contorted body now buckling and tossing Samuel over the rocky face of the water’s edge.  	204
10	1	35	5	The rocks he hit below did not spare him.  	43
10	1	35	6	Nor did the buzzards and ravens.	32
10	1	36	1	Mary collapsed into her little brother’s arms. 	47
10	1	36	2	Her face drawn out from the exhaustion.  	41
10	1	36	3	Her small black lashes from her left eye held one teardrop which finally streamed down her wrinkled cheek which she seemed mostly oblivious to.  	145
10	1	36	4	Her other eye wet Jacobs jacket.  	34
10	1	36	5	She made no sobs but heaved in sighs, and shook from the adrenaline. 	69
10	1	36	6	He too was shaking, mouth dry and too hoarse to speak, he held her and rocked her, comforting his older sister.  	113
10	1	36	7	Both collapsed from the ordeal.	31
10	1	37	1	Thomas trotted the cart along.  	32
10	1	37	2	He had told everyone they were going to Amesbury.  	51
10	1	37	3	The plan was that they would inform of the escape but give no other details..	77
10	1	38	1	Marshal Herrick would be bedridden under the care of doctors.  	63
10	1	38	2	Word spread that Samuel Endicott was missing and had gone out the same night Mary had escaped after a lot of speculation had brewed.  	134
10	1	38	3	Had Mary stayed, she would have been hung alongside Martha Corey, Margaret Scott, Mary Easty, Alice Parker, Ann Pudeator, Willmott Redd, Samuel Wardwell and Mary Parker.  	171
10	1	38	4	The people of Amesbury were never allowed to know where Mary was for a time.  	78
10	1	38	5	Her family in Salisbury missed her and held fast to her home and the story that protected her.  	96
10	1	38	6	After a few years, she would be rumored to have died there.	59
10	1	39	1	But that rumor was not the case, Thomas gathered up new supplies and took his wife to York Maine.  	99
10	1	39	2	There he met with the Wheelwright in-laws.  	44
10	1	39	3	Her eldest son’s family would continue there. 	46
10	1	39	4	Mary hid out well into January fearing capture and trial for Samuel Endicott’s murder.  	88
10	1	39	5	A high ranking person like Endicott was no trivial death to deal with.	70
10	2	1	1	Back in Salem, Increase Mather denounces the use of spectral evidence early the next month of October.  	104
10	2	1	2	Reverend John Hale switches sides the following month after Mary Herrick accuses John’s second wife, Sarah Noyes Hale of witchcraft.  	134
10	2	1	3	By spring the next year, the trials died down.  	48
10	2	1	4	William Phips shut down the court and one of the magistrates, Samuel Sewall, who had taken part in the questioning recanted his stance and publicly repented of his role in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.	203
10	3	1	1	On a beautiful May Friday morning, Mary looked up at the sky, the birds and early leaf flower blooms and as she had foreseen, this day would be the day that the last bits of darkness would have faded away enough for her to return home in Salisbury.  	250
10	3	1	2	Her husband Thomas had returned claiming to have searched for her in vain and declared her missing.  	101
10	3	1	3	Thomas looked aged from the experience. 	40
10	3	1	4	They were on high vigilance the entire time but after a while, people became preoccupied elsewhere seeing as there was no possible way to resolve it further.  	159
10	3	1	5	Her brother Jacob would go bring her back.  	44
10	3	1	6	Captain Thomas’s steps were becoming unsure and his ankles did not heal swiftly enough.	87
10	3	2	1	“Welcome home my beloved.”, came Thomas with the warmest look beaming from his tired face.	90
10	3	3	1	“Good to be home Tom” and with that, they embraced, cried and praised all heaven.	81
10	3	4	1	Wymond, her grandson came up to her, “Grandmother, we missed you!  	67
10	3	4	2	You promised me you would read me a story and teach me letters!”	64
10	3	5	1	“Oh, I definitely will.”	24
10	3	6	1	In 1695, Thomas died and left Mary with enough in his will for her to continue as well as estates for those sons and daughters who gave him heirs by way of grandchildren.  	172
10	3	6	2	Mary still cared for her spinster daughter Elizabeth, her little dandy Thomas, sending him crypt letters and packages stuffed with warm blankets and little keepsakes.  	168
10	3	6	3	She continued to care for and teach all her grandchildren in the ways of writing advising them to “write a little bit every day”. 	130
10	3	6	4	She also made them promise to keep dutiful records as both she and her husband did and to carry forward and add unto the lessons they had learned: “A journal is a bible too and no less important.  	197
10	3	6	5	Keep always a book to remember your ancestors and discover their hardships so you do not see them repeated.  	109
10	3	6	6	Fight for the meek and give justice where due.  	48
10	3	6	7	Fight against conspiracy and scapegoating so that the wisdom of the meek may survive.  	87
10	3	6	8	Stay clear of those who demonstrate folly but be a friendly acquaintance to all.  	82
10	3	6	9	You never know when you need to make a quick ally or deter a sudden foe.”	73
10	3	7	1	Mary writes a couple of stories that she reads to her children, hoping they’ll always do good and if they ever obtain skill or greatness, to always remain modest and deferent to avoid the traps of fame, warning them if they become too prideful, they will cease to have power and tumble like an old tower that few suspect has aged quite so much.  	346
10	3	7	2	As she was teaching Wymond letters, Wymond noticed Mary had a tear in her eye which progressed into some sighing and then sobs and streams of tears..	149
10	3	8	1	“Why are you crying?”	21
10	3	9	1	“Because so many others died.”, she replied, catching her breath between sobs. 	79
10	3	9	2	“I escaped the gallows, the saddest witch is not the witch who dies but the witch who lives to see the other witches die.”	122
10	3	10	1	“What is a witch exactly?”	26
10	3	11	1	“For some, it means they have obtained power and perform acts of sorcery and harm by signing the Devil’s book.  	112
10	3	11	2	For others, it just means a hag, an older woman like me, who is eccentric, for those who have conspired to bear false witness, these two are the same and so many will die because of them. 	188
10	3	11	3	They are probably worse than those who sign a book.”	52
10	3	12	1	“What does it mean to you?”	27
10	3	13	1	“Someone who has been acquainted with grief and who by the Lord’s grace, learns wisdom.”	88
10	3	14	1	Five days before Christmas in the year 1700, Mary lay in bed ill, barely able to swallow.  	91
10	3	14	2	Eighty-five is good she regularly thought to herself since her big 85th birthday in September.  	96
10	3	14	3	She died five days before Christmas, according to the wish that she wouldn’t have to explain the gifts she had given to each of her grandchildren, leaving them each a small note and a curious object that would lead them on their own adventures.	244
